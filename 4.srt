1
00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:03,328
我之前打过电话 关于一位失踪的美国公民 他现在在中东
I called earlier about a missing U.S. Citizen in the Middle East.

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,133
莎拉 你还好吗
How are you, Sara?

3
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:06,218
我需要见国务院的人 而不是你
I wanted the State Department, not you.

4
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:09,285
有没有可能波塞冬会准许我们杀了她
Any chance Poseidon will just let us kill her?

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,773
我得到了些情报
I've learned some things

6
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:12,997
很显然关乎你我正在共同寻找的人
about who it is we're apparently both looking for.

7
00:00:12,997 --> 00:00:14,746
你觉得迈克尔在也门
You think Michael's in Yemen?

8
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,069
-我们来救你出去  -我不认识你
- We're gonna get you out of here. - I don't know who you are.

9
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:20,485
你弟弟通过这家店来逃跑
Your brother was using this shop for his escape.

10
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:22,837
我们过来拿护照
We're here for passports.

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,378
我们有一天时间离开这个鬼地方
Figure we got a day to get out of this hole.

12
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:31,466
我们都会出去的 所有人
We're still getting out. All of us.

13
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:38,960
波塞冬把我们塞进来是为了救拉马尔出去
Poseidon put us in here to get Ramal out,

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,053
但之后他抛弃了我们
but then he abandoned us.

15
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,058
拉马尔是波塞冬的人 不是我们的
Ramal's Poseidon's guy, not ours.

16
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:45,317
我们的朋友告诉了我越狱计划
Our friend told me about the escape.

17
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:46,650
他会背叛你
He will betray you.

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,960
等灯都灭了
When those lights go black,

19
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,330
我们会像幽灵般从这里逃之夭夭
we're gonna disappear from this place like ghosts.

20
00:00:50,336 --> 00:00:52,170
我打不开
I can't get it open.

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,386
帮帮我上去
Help me out.

22
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:55,434
你先把我兄弟拉上来
You pull my brother up first.

23
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:03,082
别开枪
Don't shoot.

24
00:01:15,157 --> 00:01:16,234
你感觉怎么样
How are you feeling?

25
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,896
身体还好
Body is fine.

26
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:20,352
脑袋里嘛
My head is

27
00:01:20,357 --> 00:01:23,077
还在想怎么拿到那些
trying to figure out how to get those passports

28
00:01:23,072 --> 00:01:24,320
我们昨晚没拿到的护照
we couldn't get last night.

29
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,365
你和孩子们的护照
For you, those kids.

30
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:28,517
那些事
Well, that's something you shouldn't

31
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:29,898
不是你现在要担心的
be worrying about right now.

32
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:31,781
你该休息好 我们之后还需要你
You should rest up. We're gonna need you.

33
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:33,536
死了就能好好休息了
I can rest when I'm dead.

34
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:37,034
那也是我担心的
Well, that's what I'm worried about.

35
00:01:38,528 --> 00:01:40,304
我不知道你还会担心
Didn't know you worried.

36
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,304
我只担心对的事
About the right things.

37
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,592
你弟弟
Your brother.

38
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,976
他逃出来了吗
He make it out?

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,674
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:57,770
希巴 我可以和林肯单独聊一下吗
Sheba, do you mind if I borrow Linc for a second?

41
00:01:58,106 --> 00:01:59,690
-当然  -好
- Yeah. - Okay.

42
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:01,264
好好休息
Please get some rest.

43
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:14,368
听着 我们得考虑
Listen. We got to start talking

44
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:15,866
离开这个国家了
about leaving the country.

45
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:17,098
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

46
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:19,066
我跟清真寺的朋友谈过
I spoke to my friends at the mosque.

47
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:21,600
伊斯兰国将在一小时内占领周边地区
ISIL is taking neighborhoods by the hour.

48
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:23,754
如果他们切断了去机场的路线...
If they cut off the route to the airport...

49
00:02:23,754 --> 00:02:24,896
我不会丢下迈克尔的
I'm not leaving Michael.

50
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:29,653
如果他们封锁了机场 那就谁都能逃不出去了
If they cut off the airport, no one is getting out.

51
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:31,802
你 我 希巴都逃不出去
Not you, me, Sheba.

52
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:35,658
这么说我也很难过...
As much as it kills me to say...

53
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:39,056
但我们不能为了一个人...
we can't risk all of it for...

54
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:41,408
拿这一切冒险
just one man.

55
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,845
你说的对
You're right.

56
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:45,786
你走吧
You can leave.

57
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:46,869
但我不能走
But I can't.

58
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:50,288
你尽快把那家人都带去机场
Get that family to the airport as fast as you can.

59
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:51,941
我再想想办法
I'll work something out.

60
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:53,178
布鲁斯先生
Mr. Burrows?

61
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:57,834
谢谢你救了我女儿
I wanted to thank you for saving my daughter.

62
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:00,613
我想回报你
And offer you something in appreciation.

63
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:02,640
我可能有办法救你弟弟
I might have a solution for how to get your brother

64
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,792
逃出那所监狱
out of that prison.

65
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:08,810
趁这座城市还没有被夷为平地
Before the city goes to hell.

66
00:03:16,522 --> 00:03:17,936
你听到了吗
You hear that?

67
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:19,360
这次是目前最近的炮击
That was the closest one yet!

68
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,560
离我们不到100米
100 yards!

69
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,138
你还说不会更糟
Just when you think it couldn't get worse

70
00:03:22,138 --> 00:03:23,898
我们被困在这个没有出路的鬼地方了
locked up in a Porta Potti,

71
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:27,402
他们都开始往这里扔2000磅的炸弹了
they start dropping 2,000-pound bombs on the Porta Potti.

72
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:30,032
维普 冷静点
Whip. Keep it together, please.

73
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,488
越狱大师有点紧张了啊
The escape artist is nervous.

74
00:03:37,514 --> 00:03:38,549
你也应该紧张才对
You should be, too.

75
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,530
那些大炮不断攻击 炮弹可不会分辨敌我
Those artillery strikes, they don't discriminate.

76
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:43,776
我和你不一样 我有信仰
The difference is I have faith.

77
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:45,664
真主会拯救我的
Allah will deliver me.

78
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:47,285
谁来拯救你呢
What do you have?

79
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:49,525
贾
Ja!

80
00:03:49,653 --> 00:03:50,693
贾 你在吗
Ja, are you there?

81
00:03:50,704 --> 00:03:51,888
我在这儿
I'm here.

82
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:54,496
维普说的对
Whip's right.

83
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,640
袭击越来越近了
The strikes are getting closer.

84
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:58,016
我真可怜你
I pity you.

85
00:03:58,016 --> 00:03:59,616
不管如何我都会胜利
I triumph either way.

86
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,232
要么上天堂 要么真主会拯救我
Either I will be in paradise or Allah will save me.

87
00:04:03,648 --> 00:04:04,688
你
You,

88
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,746
你会死
you're just going to die.

89
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:13,170
伊斯兰国攻破了检查站
ISIL has broken through the checkpoints.

90
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:14,553
他们要进城了
They're coming into the city.

91
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:15,855
这些制服就像是
These uniforms are like targets

92
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,394
-我们背上的活靶子  -伊斯兰国还没到呢
- on our backs. - ISIL isn't here yet.

93
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,150
政府说会把他们打回去的
The government says it will push them back.

94
00:04:20,154 --> 00:04:21,890
你疯了吧 这是不可能的
You out of your head? This is happening.

95
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:23,402
萨那城已经沦陷了
Sana'a is falling.

96
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:29,701
他们要逃跑了
They're going to retreat.

97
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,048
我之前见过那种表情
I've seen that look before in the army.

98
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:34,698
他们会为了保全自己不择手段
Men who will do anything to save themselves.

99
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:36,600
那我们怎么办
And how do we save ourselves?

100
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:39,040
要是伊斯兰国攻破这座监狱 第一个杀的就是我们
ISIL takes this prison, we'll be the first they slaughter.

101
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:40,960
他们攻下这座监狱
When they take this prison, it will be

102
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,178
是为了解救他们的领袖拉马尔
to liberate their leader, Ramal,

103
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:45,034
但如果他们进来的时候
but if when they get here,

104
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,242
我们拿刀
we have him with a knife

105
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,544
抵住拉马尔的喉咙
to his throat,

106
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,186
然后我们就有话语权了
then we call the shots.

107
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:51,866
说不定能活下来
And we might just live.

108
00:04:52,144 --> 00:04:54,437
维普 我有本圣母经[双关语 也有绝妙的点子的意思]
Whip, I got a Hail Mary.

109
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:56,560
-你要祈祷还是有点子了  -点子
- That a prayer or a plan? - Plan.

110
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,469
我上次进这里的时候留下了些东西
I left something the last time I was in here.

111
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:00,453
我猜猜 你碰上了意外
Let me guess, you got a contingency.

112
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,100
他们关了我4年
They lock me away in a box for four years.

113
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,653
我是不会坐以待毙的
I'm not just gonna sit there.

114
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:05,470
机会渺茫 但有可能让我们逃出去
It's a long shot, but it might get us out.

115
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,856
异教徒还想着逃跑
The infidel still tries to escape.

116
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:08,870
绝望的小老鼠
The desperate rat.

117
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,709
我们这些绝望的小老鼠一出去
The desperate rat's gonna light you up

118
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:11,770
就会烧死你
once we get out of here,

119
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:13,710
-你这个长着虫眼的变态  -维普
- you bugged-eyed freak. - Whip.

120
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:16,140
维普 一个S 那儿有没有一个S
Whip! An "S." Is there an "S"

121
00:05:16,154 --> 00:05:17,440
刻在角落的墙上
carved in your wall chest high

122
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,928
大概胸部高的地方
in the corner?

123
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:21,790
拜托 拜托
Come on, come on.

124
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:22,992
没有
That's not it.

125
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:25,418
我什么都没看到
I'm not seeing anything.

126
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:26,600
没看到
I'm not seeing it.

127
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,458
贾 那肯定在你那儿了
Ja, it's got to be you.

128
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:30,320
快 告诉我你墙上刻着一个S
Come on. Tell me you got an "S" Carved in your wall.

129
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,463
那是我们最后的机会了
It's our last chance.

130
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:32,510
没有
No.

131
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,405
没在这儿 没有
It's not here, no.

132
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:52,150
那是因为在我这儿
That's because I have it in my cell.

133
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:57,648
我的军队
My armies of the caliphate

134
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,141
越来越近了
are coming closer.

135
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,669
他们一到这个地方
The moment they reach this place,

136
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,282
你们这些人 就会像狗一样被干掉
all of you will be put down like the dogs that you are.

137
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:52,234
好了 萨拉
All right, Sara.

138
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:55,536
我们的朋友波塞冬露面了
Our friend, Poseidon, has surfaced.

139
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:09,525
天呐
Good God.

140
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:11,232
伊斯兰国又攻击了
Another ISIL attack.

141
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,480
他们在把这个城市撕成碎片
They're ripping the city apart.

142
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:16,298
他们就是禽兽
They're animals.

143
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,093
我一辈子都是个官僚主义者
I've been a bureaucrat my whole life.

144
00:07:19,114 --> 00:07:19,984
但我很讨厌官僚主义
Hated it.

145
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:22,400
贪污 黑幕
Corruption, backslapping.

146
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:25,200
但今天 官僚主义可能也有点好处
But today, maybe some good will come of it.

147
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:26,848
我跟这个叫易卜拉欣的男生
I went to grammar school with this boy

148
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:28,160
一起读的初中
named Ibrahim.

149
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:31,185
这些年后 他成了联邦法官
All the years later, he's a federal judge.

150
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:34,320
你是说这个法官能帮我们吗
You, uh, saying this judge can help us?

151
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,050
几小时前我给他打了电话
I called him a few hours ago and told him

152
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,440
和他说了你弟弟的案子
about your brother's case.

153
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:41,578
你重新装潢了
Redecorating, I see.

154
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:45,229
为了即将到来的变动做好准备
Just readying for the coming change of seasons.

155
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:49,098
奢侈品令伊斯兰教徒不悦
Luxury is something the Wahabbists frown upon,

156
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:52,036
所以要把它们藏起来
so luxury will stay behind closed doors.

157
00:07:52,043 --> 00:07:53,570
你该逃离这个国家
You should flee the country.

158
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:55,120
我不会死的 你知道的
I'm a survivor, you know that.

159
00:07:55,483 --> 00:07:57,127
也许布鲁斯先生
I thought Mr. Burrows could perhaps

160
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:58,683
能帮得上他弟弟的忙
help with his brother's cause.

161
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,978
噢 对了
Ah, yes.

162
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,272
最高司法委员会的无条件赦免
A full pardon from the Supreme Judicial Council.

163
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,290
但交易结束后才能给你
But you will have to uphold your end of the bargain,

164
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,127
贾米勒
Jamil.

165
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:15,980
德国车 公里数七万七
German engineering. 77,000 miles.

166
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,421
油耗五升 七速变速箱 V10发动机
Five liter, seven speed, V10.

167
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:21,069
是个受欢迎的奢侈品
It will be a welcome bit of luxury.

168
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:23,287
当然 不为人知
Behind closed doors, of course.

169
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:25,367
祝你们好运
Best of luck to both of you.

170
00:08:26,443 --> 00:08:27,454
非常感谢你帮忙
I really appreciate this.

171
00:08:27,454 --> 00:08:28,385
谢谢
Thank you.

172
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:30,007
事已至此
It's already done.

173
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,061
反正也留不了
It would've been left behind anyhow.

174
00:08:37,854 --> 00:08:38,880
希望我们的家人
May both of our families

175
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:40,850
今夜都能从萨那安全逃出
get safely out of Sana'a tonight.

176
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:45,330
我们不能在这里坐以待毙
We can't just sit here and die.

177
00:08:45,338 --> 00:08:47,650
你有个跟这一样的窗户 对吧
You-you got a window like this one, right?

178
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,967
我们也许可以撬开它
Maybe we can pry it.

179
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:50,850
这窗户太小而且经过加固
It's too small, reinforced.

180
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:52,741
基础结构里内置了钢筋
Built into the rebar infrastructure.

181
00:08:52,756 --> 00:08:54,196
你在外面有接应的吧
You got people on the outside, right?

182
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:55,556
他们会想办法救我们出去的
And they're gonna try and get us out.

183
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:56,850
他们本该昨晚在商店与我们汇合
They were supposed to meet us at the shop

184
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:58,261
但我们没出现
last night and we didn't show.

185
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,549
我们不能放弃
We can't just quit

186
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:02,210
-被波塞冬击败  -拉马尔
- and let Poseidon beat us. - Ramal?

187
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:03,927
如果我们携手 还有一个办法可以逃出去
There's a way out if we work together,

188
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:06,320
但必须先从你的牢房开始
but escape has to start from your cell.

189
00:09:06,385 --> 00:09:08,261
我再也感兴趣了
I'm no longer interested.

190
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,745
你唯一能做的就是摇尾乞怜
The only thing left for you to do is to beg.

191
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,763
等我的人来了后 求我饶你一命
Beg that I might let you live once my armies came,

192
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:16,509
前提是作为奴隶
if only as a slave.

193
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:18,581
这七年我一直是奴隶
I've been a slave for the last seven years.

194
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:20,240
我不会再当了
I won't do it anymore!

195
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:25,992
你死了以后我会想你的
I will miss you when you're dead,

196
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:28,043
不过也就想个一分钟
but only for a minute.

197
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,665
然后 你就会被
Then you will be forgotten

198
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,941
时间和世界遗忘
by both time and the world.

199
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,661
她也是我的女儿 辛迪
Well, she's my kid, too, Cindy.

200
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,152
周末是我的...
I have the weekends and...

201
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:39,767
不行 周末是我的
Well, no, I have the weekends

202
00:09:39,774 --> 00:09:41,134
我不要周三下午
and I don't want a Wednesday afternoon.

203
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:42,429
我为什么要那样
Why would I want that?

204
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,785
没人会想
Yeah, nobody does.

205
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,069
这样可以 辛迪
No, that's okay, Cindy.

206
00:10:03,345 --> 00:10:04,341
没问题
Yeah, that's fine.

207
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:05,512
其它天呢
What other days?

208
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,032
你还要想要哪些天
What other days do you want?

209
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:13,905
你知道吗
Actually, you know what?

210
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:15,912
我现在不想谈这个
I don't want to discuss this now.

211
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,101
不 我们之后再谈
No, we'll talk about it later.

212
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:19,316
挂了
Bye.

213
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,640
我被释放以后
Of all the things

214
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:26,661
这个世界里最困扰我的
that mystify me in this world

215
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:28,363
其中一件事情
since I've been released,

216
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,367
就是甘蓝的风靡一时
is that kale is the rage.

217
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:32,938
甘蓝
Kale.

218
00:10:34,014 --> 00:10:35,380
西奥多·巴格威尔
Theodore Bagwell.

219
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,701
同样让我迷惑的
Thing that mystifies me equally

220
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:39,050
是七年前
is seven years ago,

221
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:41,025
你赦免了迈克尔
you exonerated Michael,

222
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,560
林肯 所有人
Lincoln, all of them,

223
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,450
除了我
except me.

224
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:48,218
-逗我呢  -爽
- Really? - Yes!

225
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,294
你就为这事来找我吗
That's why you're here?

226
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:51,643
因为我没赦免你吗
Because I didn't exonerate you?

227
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:52,683
一个杀人犯
A murderer,

228
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:55,010
多次性侵犯
a sexual predator a dozen times over.

229
00:10:55,018 --> 00:10:57,047
这都是"过去"的事了
"Was" Is the key word.

230
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,163
我现在是光明正大的人
I'm a man moving toward the light now,

231
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:00,240
正义还在召唤我
and the light's beckoning me.

232
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,221
我只是不知道是谁在幕后操纵
I just don't know who's pulling the strings.

233
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:05,440
不过萨拉说是你
But Sara says it's you.

234
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:07,287
噢 萨拉派你来找我的吗
Oh, Sara put you onto me?

235
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,185
好吧
Okay.

236
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,418
我不知道谁更蠢
I don't know who the bigger idiot is,

237
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,349
你还是她
you or her.

238
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,730
我在帮她忙
I was helping her.

239
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:18,029
你黑了她手机还派人
You were hacking her phone and sending those people

240
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,600
跟踪她...别...
after her... Don't...

241
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:21,018
撒谎
lie.

242
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,458
现在...
Now...

243
00:11:26,181 --> 00:11:28,843
不如告诉我你的其中一个见不得人的任务
how about you pour me one of them nasty little kale jobbies,

244
00:11:28,945 --> 00:11:31,585
和斯科菲尔德与我有什么关系
and tell me what's all this got to do with Scofield and myself,

245
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:32,829
你的朋友是谁
who your friends are,

246
00:11:32,836 --> 00:11:34,181
你是谁...我想看看
who you are... I want to see

247
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:36,421
幕后操纵我的究竟是谁
the true face of who's pulling my strings

248
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:38,363
彻底搞清楚
once and for all.

249
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,010
有两位来访者在大厅等您
You have two visitors in the lobby.

250
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:45,323
告诉他们我马上就来
Tell them I'll be right down.

251
00:11:57,003 --> 00:11:57,701
嗨
Hey.

252
00:11:58,298 --> 00:11:59,425
交给我 格蕾丝
I got this, Grace.

253
00:12:12,443 --> 00:12:13,752
他们在城里
They're in the city.

254
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:20,734
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

255
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,196
你觉得呢
What do you think I'm doing?

256
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:24,050
狗东西 不许逃
Don't run, you dog!

257
00:12:24,116 --> 00:12:25,229
不许逃
Don't run!

258
00:12:25,854 --> 00:12:28,080
他们要逃了 准备好
It is happening. Be ready.

259
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,709
这个赦免令最好能把他救出来
This pardon better get him out of here.

260
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,060
时间不够了...我们必须去见监狱长
We don't have much time... we have to get to the warden.

261
00:12:39,621 --> 00:12:40,530
怎么回事
What's going on?

262
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:47,854
他们准备弃狱 所以易卜拉欣
They're abandoning the prison. That's why Ibrahim

263
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:48,843
给我们赦免令
gave us that pardon.

264
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:50,261
他知道根本没用
He knew it was worthless.

265
00:12:50,858 --> 00:12:52,480
你和C-Note带其他人去机场
You and C-Note get the others to the airport

266
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,712
越快越好... 也许还有航班
as fast as you can... There's maybe one flight out.

267
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:56,189
留两座位
Save two seats.

268
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:56,778
好吗
All right?

269
00:12:57,934 --> 00:12:58,930
你准备怎么做
What are you going to do?

270
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,421
我要去救我弟弟
I'm gonna get my brother.

271
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:12,189
穆斯塔法
Mustapha!

272
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:24,123
后退
Back up!

273
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:26,174
后退 近我者死
Back up. Anyone comes at me, dies.

274
00:13:26,174 --> 00:13:28,698
-懂吗  -你能打死我们所有人吗
- Understand? - You think you can shoot all of us?

275
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,465
谁还想碰运气
Anyone else want to play the lottery?

276
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:34,581
一群垃圾
Huh? You're filth.

277
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,610
就让伊斯兰国收拾你们吧
I'll let ISIL sort you out.

278
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,334
穆斯塔法
Mustapha!

279
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,450
穆斯塔法 等等我
Mustapha! Mustapha, wait!

280
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,098
别把我关在这
Don't lock me in here!

281
00:13:45,469 --> 00:13:46,690
你个懦夫
You coward.

282
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,825
穆斯塔法 求求你
Mustapha, please.

283
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,440
懦夫
Coward!

284
00:13:57,178 --> 00:13:59,607
我要进去 我要进去
I need to get in! I need to get out!

285
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:01,541
-给我钥匙  -我没钥匙
- Well, give me the key. - I don't have the key.

286
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:03,054
你和有钥匙的人擦肩而过
You passed the guy who does.

287
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,949
退后 我不想杀你们
Stay back! I don't want to shoot you!

288
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:48,610
警卫都跑了
The guards are gone!

289
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,181
他们弃狱而逃
They're abandoning their posts!

290
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:53,789
我们要自由了
We're gonna be free!

291
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:56,472
不 我们没有
No. We're not free.

292
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:58,850
情况变得更糟了
Things just got a lot worse.

293
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:00,378
把门撞开
Push the gate open!

294
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:01,716
停 停
Stop! Stop!

295
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:02,821
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

296
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:05,090
-我们必须逃出去  -如果伊斯兰国占领了城市
- We have to get through the gate! - If ISIL controls the city,

297
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:07,549
像他们说的那样 外面也一样水深火热
like they say, it will be a prison out there as well.

298
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,192
如果我们被关在这里
We will be persecuted,

299
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,389
我们会被处死 情况只会变得更糟
as we have been in here, only worse!

300
00:15:11,396 --> 00:15:12,589
至少还有活的机会
At least there's a chance!

301
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:13,706
你们想要机会是吗
You want a chance?

302
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,504
我们的机会就在那里
Our chance lies in there,

303
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,762
单人牢房里
in solitary.

304
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,230
我们的筹码
Our bargaining chip.

305
00:15:18,736 --> 00:15:20,042
我们拿下阿布·拉马尔
We get Abu Ramal!

306
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:21,365
我们可以谈判
We negotiate passage

307
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,746
离开这个国家
out of the country.

308
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:24,512
不 这太疯狂了
No, it's madness.

309
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:27,386
拜托 如果我们合作 可以推开这道门
Come on. If we work together, we can push open the gate.

310
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:28,730
是你吗 小公主
Is that you, Princess?

311
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:31,504
是你 我们都记得这家伙
It is you. We remember this one!

312
00:15:31,504 --> 00:15:33,568
-对吗 我们都记得他  -拜托...
- Right? We remember him! - Please...

313
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:35,717
坎尼尔·奥提斯的朋友
Friend to Kaniel Outis,

314
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:37,994
那个不愿意对我弟弟伸出援手的男人
the man who would not lend my brother a hand!

315
00:15:37,994 --> 00:15:40,128
依我看 他才是
The man who killed my brother,

316
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:42,229
杀掉我弟弟的人 对吧
as far as I'm concerned, right?

317
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:44,752
-我们进去拿下阿布·拉马尔  -不 拜托
- We are going to go in there and get Abu Ramal! - No! Please!

318
00:15:44,757 --> 00:15:46,197
-不 拜托  -等我们进去里面后
- No! Please! - And when we are there,

319
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:50,720
我会亲手割开坎尼尔·奥提斯的喉咙
I am personally going to slice Kaniel Outis' throat.

320
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,658
而你 就是帮我实现这件事的人
And you are going to be the one who's going to help me do it.

321
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:55,237
-不  -你押他过去
- No! - You sent him!

322
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:56,224
带上他
Take him!

323
00:15:56,224 --> 00:15:57,322
你们所有人
All of you!

324
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,157
你们是要留在这里
Will you stay here?

325
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,424
等着被伊斯兰国的人屠杀
And let ISIL slaughter you?

326
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:03,660
还是跟我一起
Or will you stand with me?

327
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,253
抵抗他们
And fight!

328
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,381
听起来可不乐观
Doesn't sound very promising!

329
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:12,709
拉马尔
Ramal,

330
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,341
你要重新考虑一下帮助我们吗
you want to rethink helping us?

331
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:15,541
越狱必须从
Escape has to start

332
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,336
你的牢房开始
from your cell!

333
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:18,178
你们这些异教徒都可以下地狱
All you infidels can go to Hell!

334
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:20,352
我们现在就在地狱 拉马尔
We are in Hell, Ramal.

335
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:22,506
问题是 你想离开吗
Question is do you want out?

336
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,845
撞开这扇门
Smash through the door!

337
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:33,424
告诉我该怎么做
Tell me what to do.

338
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,866
快点 快点...
Come on, come on...

339
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,290
我没有黑过任何人的手机
I'm not hacking anybody's phones.

340
00:17:25,317 --> 00:17:26,677
这件事你完全搞错了
You're so off base on this,

341
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:27,664
你根本不明白
you have no idea.

342
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:28,416
我不明白吗
Am I?

343
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,224
是 是的
Y-Yes.

344
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:34,485
这菜汁太难喝了
That is terrible,

345
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,069
顺带问一下 那是什么
by the way. What is that,

346
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:37,392
悔悟行为吗
an act of contrition?

347
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:39,461
像苦行僧的粗毛衬衣
Like a hair shirt?

348
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:43,040
喝蔬菜汁折磨自己来弥补你的的罪过吗
Torture yourself with kale to make up for your sins?

349
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,858
我没有任何罪过 伙计
I don't have any sins anymore, man.

350
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,088
-你才有罪  -欺骗罪怎么样
- That's you. - How about the sin of deceit?

351
00:17:47,594 --> 00:17:48,277
嗯哼
Hmm?

352
00:17:48,805 --> 00:17:51,904
一个叫做凯勒曼的在白天喝蔬菜汁的男人
A kale-drinking man named Kellerman by the light of day,

353
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,008
一个叫做波塞冬的在晚上蓄意杀人的CIA禽兽
a murderous CIA rogue named Poseidon at night.

354
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,952
波塞冬
Poseidon?

355
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,085
他的眼睛发光了
His eyes light up.

356
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,210
她是对的
She was right.

357
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:01,269
噢 你认为我是波塞冬吗
Oh, you think I'm Poseidon?

358
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,280
好吧
Okay.

359
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:06,282
你和波塞冬搞混了吗
Are you mixed up with Poseidon?

360
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:06,864
噢 见鬼
Oh, hell,

361
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:08,517
我们非得用些老办法吗
we got to go old school with this?

362
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:09,285
那是你想要的吗
Is that what you want?

363
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,933
-T-Bag式断手指
- T-Bag snapping fingers.

364
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:13,536
这非常... 你刚好给了我一些可以合作的信息
That's very... you just gave me something to work with.

365
00:18:13,536 --> 00:18:15,365
-波塞冬吗  -波塞冬
- Poseidon? - Poseidon.

366
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:20,480
我会告诉你波塞冬的事情
I'll tell you about Poseidon.

367
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,760
我是说 他就是你听说过的这个体系中的神话之一
I mean, he's one of those myths you hear about in the system.

368
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,397
他是一个触不可及的特工
He's an operative so untouchable,

369
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:28,165
藏得如此之深 如果没有核潜艇 你根本找不到他
so deep, you couldn't find him with a nuclear sub.

370
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:29,338
这就是他的绰号的来源
Hence the nickname.

371
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:31,376
那么这是怎么牵涉到我的
And how does this involve me?

372
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,584
他想从迈克尔那里得到什么
What's he want with Michael?

373
00:18:36,186 --> 00:18:37,980
拉马尔 听清楚了
Ramal, listen closely.

374
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:39,914
刻有S的那块砖是松的
The brick with the "S," It's loose.

375
00:18:39,925 --> 00:18:41,285
你要移开它
You got to remove it.

376
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,477
里面有一把勺子和一根绳
It's a spoon, string.

377
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:54,896
-怎么做  -那绳子来自
- How? - A string a day from

378
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:56,661
我穿了四年的狱服
my uniforms for four years.

379
00:18:56,965 --> 00:19:00,213
勺子是千百次机会才被狱警忽视一次得到的
A spoon a guard overlooked one time in a thousand.

380
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:02,416
你的头上有一根水管
There's a water pipe above you.

381
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,133
钩住它 把它拉下来
Hook it, pull it down.

382
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:06,309
快做
Do it!

383
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:17,797
喂 我直说了 这是救他出去吗
Hey. Let me get this straight. This is getting him out?

384
00:19:17,797 --> 00:19:18,990
这是救我们所有人出去
It's getting us all out.

385
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,960
这需要两个牢房的合作 我的和他的
This is a two-cell job, mine and his.

386
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,344
那就是我在那个牢房时不能拉下水管的原因
That's why I couldn't pull it off when I was in that cell,

387
00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:24,512
因为我对面牢房的那个人
because the guy across from me,

388
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,109
当时在这个牢房里的人 不愿意合作
the guy in this cell, wouldn't cooperate.

389
00:19:27,322 --> 00:19:28,869
我们必须合作
We have to work together.

390
00:19:28,885 --> 00:19:29,802
快点
Come on!

391
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:31,365
-不  -十字架[绰号]
- No. - Cross!

392
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,890
我不会跟你合作的
I'm not working with you.

393
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,688
不 不
No. No.

394
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:38,810
来这里 过来 小甜心
Come here! Come on, sweetheart.

395
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,461
亮下你漂亮的脸 来 上到这来
Show them your pretty face! Come on, get up here!

396
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:43,002
看着 停下你们正在做的事
Look! Stop what you're doing

397
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:45,434
告诉坎尼尔·奥提斯我会杀了这个娘炮
and tell Kaniel Outis I will kill the girl!

398
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:48,037
把他带走
Take him!

399
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:51,120
快点 我们俩还没完
Come on! I'm not through with you yet!

400
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,045
他们在外面揍希德 他们会杀了他
They're beating the crap out of Sid. They'll kill him

401
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:54,944
-除非我们投降  -如果我们投降
- unless we surrender. - If we surrender,

402
00:19:54,949 --> 00:19:56,810
他们会杀了我们 他们只想需要拉马尔
they'll kill us. They only want Ramal.

403
00:19:57,802 --> 00:19:59,824
我们救希德最好的机会是离开这里
Our best chance of saving Sid is getting out of here.

404
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,346
让他们忽略掉他 转而来追我们
Make them forget about him, start chasing us.

405
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:05,936
好吧 好吧
Okay, good.

406
00:20:05,962 --> 00:20:08,021
现在捡起它 把绳子系上去
Now pick it up. String the cord

407
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:09,104
穿过它
and pull it through.

408
00:20:09,664 --> 00:20:11,310
加油 加油
Come on, come on!

409
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:12,037
耶
Yeah!

410
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:15,360
我会杀了这个娘炮 我发誓
I will kill the girl, I swear it!

411
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:16,304
别
No!

412
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:24,357
我再说一遍
I will say it again,

413
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:26,910
在我的监管下
there will not be any killing in this prison!

414
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,656
这个监狱里不允许有任何杀戮
Not on my watch!

415
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:30,485
这简直是疯了
This is completely insane.

416
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:32,789
外面正在上演该死的墨西哥肥皂剧
It's a freakin' Mexican soap opera out here!

417
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:36,620
拉马尔 别停下 别胡思乱想
Ramal, don't stop. Don't start thinking.

418
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,704
别把希望寄托在一个狱警上
Don't pin your hopes on one guard.

419
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:40,773
走开
Walk away!

420
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:42,784
躲到牢房里去
Hide in the cell block!

421
00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:47,050
你在做什么
What are you doing?

422
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,418
监狱已经完了 老兄
The prison is done, brother.

423
00:20:49,424 --> 00:20:50,768
看在上帝的份上
For the love of God!

424
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:53,157
看在上帝的份上 一个男人正在寻求正义
For the love of God, a man seeks justice.

425
00:20:53,157 --> 00:20:55,466
这就是他每时每刻都在做的事情
In everything he does, at all times!

426
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:57,546
现在 所有人 回到你们的牢房里
Now, everybody, back in the block!

427
00:20:57,546 --> 00:20:59,840
这里已经不存在犯人和狱警了
There are no prisoners and guards anymore!

428
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,706
你也意识到了 对吗
You realize that, right?

429
00:21:01,722 --> 00:21:03,560
一旦伊斯兰国的人到了这里
If ISIL gets in here,

430
00:21:03,978 --> 00:21:06,128
我们都是他们的敌人
we are all the enemy.

431
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,765
罪人
Sinners,

432
00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:09,253
异教徒...
deviants...

433
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,762
和那些关住他们首领的人
and those that locked up their leader.

434
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,485
你将是他们抓获的唯一的狱警
You will be the only guard that they catch.

435
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:18,133
高尚的那个
The noble one.

436
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,605
他们会砍掉你的头 但是...
They will behead you for it. But...

437
00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:23,650
如果我们合作
if we work together,

438
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:25,365
我们抓住拉马尔
we get Ramal,

439
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,013
我们就有了筹码
we have a bargaining chip.

440
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:28,618
我会安排好一切
I will see to it

441
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:31,616
你能跟我们一起离开这里
that you will get out with the rest of us.

442
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:35,098
只要你给我单人牢房的钥匙
Just give me the keys to solitary.

443
00:21:35,584 --> 00:21:36,608
我没有那些钥匙
I don't have the keys.

444
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:37,930
我知道你有
I know you do.

445
00:21:39,253 --> 00:21:40,560
加入我们
Join us

446
00:21:41,157 --> 00:21:42,458
你就能活下来
and you will live.

447
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,770
我向你保证
I give you my word.

448
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:46,496
我没有钥匙
I don't have them.

449
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,080
杀了他
Kill him!

450
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:57,636
但是你有更好的东西 不是吗
But you have something much better, huh?

451
00:22:02,065 --> 00:22:03,672
让开 让开
Move. Move!

452
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:05,025
我的天
Oh, my God.

453
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,690
天啦 他们杀了警卫
Oh, my God. They killed the guard!

454
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,080
警卫死了 他们要来找我们了
The guard is gone, they're comging for us.

455
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:19,098
一定要成功 拉马尔
Got to make this count, Ramal.

456
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:21,810
把鱼竿从小槽伸出来
String that fishing pole through that slot.

457
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,134
就这样
That's right.

458
00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:24,843
现在 把轮轴拿掉
Now, you can remove the pinions

459
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,516
在我的门上...铰链
on my door... the hinges.

460
00:22:26,523 --> 00:22:27,672
有两个
There are two of them.

461
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,425
不可能
No way.

462
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,098
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

463
00:22:37,381 --> 00:22:38,378
干什么呢
What are you doing?

464
00:22:38,385 --> 00:22:39,563
我要开我的门
I'm doing mine.

465
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,832
我们没时间浪费了 拉马尔
We don't have time for this, Ramal!

466
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,992
我跟你说 这需要两间牢房合作
I'm telling you, it's a two-cell job,

467
00:22:51,992 --> 00:22:53,716
那才是关键 这一边的牢房
that's the point. That side of the wing

468
00:22:53,723 --> 00:22:55,476
都是新装的 那些轮轴
is new construction. The pinions

469
00:22:55,476 --> 00:22:57,120
都被铰链遮住了... 你弄不掉的
are covered in the hinges... You can't pull them.

470
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,650
我这边的是老式的 没有铰链 而且很松
This side is original. They're open, loose.

471
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:01,338
你想让我放了你
You want me to free you?

472
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:04,414
然后我会去拿那边的钥匙再放了你
Yes, and I, in turn, free you with those keys, down there.

473
00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:06,501
我为什么要信你 不信外面那个疯子
Why would I trust you more than the madman out there?

474
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:08,916
因为你也听见了他的话到底有几分能信
Cause you just heard what his word is worth.

475
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,014
踹门
Kick it.

476
00:23:18,407 --> 00:23:20,669
你选吧 到底谁更值得相信
This is it. It's all about whose word you trust.

477
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:23,265
我发誓... 你放了我
I promise you... you release me,

478
00:23:23,796 --> 00:23:24,967
我就放了你
I release you.

479
00:23:38,763 --> 00:23:40,596
再来点 再来点
Little more, little more.

480
00:23:49,338 --> 00:23:50,654

491
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:34,650
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

492
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,985
放了我
Open my door.

493
00:24:39,003 --> 00:24:40,720
我要赶快从这鬼地方走人
I'm getting the hell out of here.

494
00:24:41,483 --> 00:24:42,560

- Leave him, man, you crazy? - Open my door.

496
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,450
我们一旦出去了
Once we're outside these walls, we need

497
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:50,196
需要能顺利出国的安全路线

都现在了 你还想谈条件
Even now, you negotiate.

499
00:24:53,338 --> 00:24:56,349
不合作 咱们都得死
We work together or we both die.

500
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:00,130

- This is no place for you. - You gonna fight ISIL men?

509
00:25:37,192 --> 00:25:37,985
对
Yes.

510
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,694
你仔细听好了 好吗
Listen very closely, all right?

只杀你的朋友 懂了吗
Just your friends. You understand?

519
00:26:38,589 --> 00:26:40,647
来这儿干嘛 有什么用啊
What are we doing in here? This is not helping us.

520
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,614
为了遵守咱们的约定
You're gonna make a phone call

521
00:26:41,621 --> 00:26:43,396
你得打个电话出去
so you can hold up your end of the deal.

522
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:45,534
纳什温广场有一间汽车维修厂
There's an auto body shop off Nashwan plaza.

523

这样我们所有人才能去边境
so we can get to the border, all of us.

525
00:26:48,712 --> 00:26:50,021
我不要跟你去边境
I'm not going with you to the border.

你没得选
You don't have a choice.

527
00:26:51,003 --> 00:26:53,316
到了边境 我们就能分开了

528
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,218

You understand?

531
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,876
还是说你想当外面那些人的保票  拿着
Or would you rather be their insurance? Take it.

532
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,065
我想知道他说了什么 他有可能会耍咱们
I want to know what he's saying. He could be screwing us.

533
00:27:14,072 --> 00:27:15,636
他肯定是在耍我们
He's screwing with us, all right.

534
00:27:15,658 --> 00:27:17,367
我们得在他动手前先弄他
We just need to screw with him first.

535
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:18,567
贾呢
Where's Ja?

536
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:19,549

镇痛药...
Percocet...

539
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:28,960

Come on, you Japanese junkie son of a bitch.

540

我是韩国人 你个加拿大猴子
I'm Korean, you Canadian monkey.

541
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,672
加拿大人 真搞笑 贾
Canadian? Oh, that's really funny, Ja.

542
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:35,800
咱们要不是快被杀了 我一定会笑岔气的
You'd split my sides if we weren't about to be slaughtered.

543
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,349
嘿 记住伍迪·艾伦说的话[著名美国导演]
Hey, remember what Woody Allen said.

544
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:39,992
说了什么
What did he say?

545
00:27:40,632 --> 00:27:41,934
"我并不怕死
"I don't mind dying.

546
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:44,218
只不过是想在它来临时我恰巧不在"
I just don't want to be around when it happens."

547
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,392
嘿 好了
Hey, come on.

548
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:48,618
我们需要你 好吗
We need you, okay?

549
00:27:48,654 --> 00:27:49,905
磨蹭什么呢
What's the holdup?

550
00:28:14,603 --> 00:28:16,181
斯科菲尔德死定了
Scofield's a dead man.

551
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:17,621
敢和波塞冬有纠葛
He's tangling with Poseidon.

552
00:28:17,636 --> 00:28:18,778
我知道你想干什么了
I see what you're doing here.

553
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:21,694
用第三人称说波塞冬
Talking Poseidon in third person,

554
00:28:21,709 --> 00:28:22,923
假装你不是他
like you're not him.

555
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,203
国务院寻找波塞冬

找了好几年了
looking for Poseidon for years,

557
00:28:26,014 --> 00:28:28,429
你个傻子 他是中情局的叛变特工
you idiot. He's a rogue CIA operative.

558
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,432
没人知道他是谁
Nobody knows who he is.

559
00:28:29,432 --> 00:28:31,149
-开始瞎编了  -我知道
- Here we go. - I know it's a little

560
00:28:31,156 --> 00:28:33,301
你一个普通罪犯肯定不会懂的
above your pay grade being a common criminal.

561
00:28:33,454 --> 00:28:35,192
我们说的就只是一个人
I mean, we're talking about a single man.

562
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,305
对吗 一只猎鹰
Right? A hawk

563
00:28:36,312 --> 00:28:38,414
他不喜欢白宫处理
who apparently doesn't like how the White House

564
00:28:38,414 --> 00:28:40,218
对外政策的方式
goes about foreign policy,

565
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:42,247
所以决定自己动手
and decided to take matters into his own hands.

566
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,196
不用军队 不搞武装侵略
Not with armies, not with invasions,

567
00:28:44,196 --> 00:28:45,840
只需要杀一个人
but by getting a single person killed,

568
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,436
或者让一个人当选
by getting a single person elected to office,

569
00:28:48,443 --> 00:28:52,160
再或者把一个人从监狱放出来
by getting a single person released from prison.

570
00:28:52,407 --> 00:28:54,523
监狱 迈克尔在的那个也门监狱吗
Prison, like the one in Yemen, where Michael's at.

571
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,050
想听我的猜测吗
You want my guess?

572
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:59,450
阿布·拉马尔才是波塞冬想放出来的那个人
It's Abu Ramal that Poseidon wants free.

573
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:01,120
我在监狱里的电视上看过他
Guy I seen on the prison telly.

574
00:29:01,396 --> 00:29:04,552
等一下 我以为中情局是负责杀掉恐怖分子
Wait, I thought the CIA was supposed to kill terrorists,

575
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,981
-而不是放了他们啊  -波塞冬已经不是中情局的了
- not release them. - Poseidon is no longer CIA.

576
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,203
他不需要向谁复命
He doesn't report to anybody.

577
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,167
他只按自己的想法行事
He just pursues his own ideology.

578
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,458
好 举个例子 听好了
Okay, for instance, listen.

579
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:15,076
这样说 你觉得俄罗斯和伊朗
Let's say you think Russia and Iran

580
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,600
在中东地区势力太大了
are having too much influence in the Middle East,

581
00:29:17,621 --> 00:29:18,901
你认为美国政府
and you don't think Washington

582
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:20,470
做的不好
is getting the job done.

583
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,890
所以你放了拉马尔
You free Ramal.

584
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,385
没错 他是个激进的伊斯兰疯子
Sure, he's an Islamic radical nut job,

585
00:29:24,392 --> 00:29:26,720
但是他能帮你打击伊朗和俄罗斯 对吧
but he will fight Iran and Russia for you.

586
00:29:26,952 --> 00:29:29,130
敌人的敌人是我的朋友
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

587
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,570
波塞冬的精明之处在于
And what's so shrewd about Poseidon

588
00:29:31,585 --> 00:29:33,338
他做的这些都不借助网络
is he does it all without a network,

589
00:29:33,425 --> 00:29:34,981
所以他才这么难找
which is why he's so hard to find.

590
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,498
一个人就能做到这样吗
One man can pull strings like that?

591
00:29:37,498 --> 00:29:39,890
一个控制着一大堆人的人
One man manipulating a handful of others.

592
00:29:40,276 --> 00:29:42,334
阿布·拉马尔是个禽兽
Abu Ramal is a monster.

593
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,287
地狱早已经给他留好位置了
And there's a spot in Hell reserved for him,

594
00:29:46,014 --> 00:29:49,221
但是最热门的位置还是要留给波塞冬
but the hottest spot is reserved for Poseidon,

595
00:29:49,243 --> 00:29:51,970
因为他要让拉马尔重见天日
because he is letting Ramal loose on the world again.

596
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,589
那些人 他们手上有
Those men, they have the blood of thousands,

597
00:29:54,603 --> 00:29:57,592
成千上万人的血
thousands on their hands.

598
00:29:57,694 --> 00:29:59,847
跟他们比 咱们俩简直是天使
Compared to them, you and me are a couple of angels.

599
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:04,483
"天使"
"Angels"?

600
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,985
你发现了波塞冬是谁
You find out who Poseidon is,

601
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,987
也知道了斯科菲尔德是如何被困
and how Scofield is wrapped up in it,

602
00:30:08,022 --> 00:30:10,456
也许你命中注定
maybe your fate...

603
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:12,391
要成为爱国者
is to be a patriot.

604
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:16,529
怎么回事
What...?

605
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:25,638
快走
Go. Go!

606
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,464
还有时间做任何事
There's a time for everything.

607
00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:58,149
911 我需要援助 马上
911? I need help... now.

608
00:31:04,052 --> 00:31:05,612
他们要往上走
They're going over the top.

609
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,353
我们走
Let's go.

610
00:31:22,075 --> 00:31:24,337
快走 快走 快走
Go, go, go, go, go!

611
00:31:24,372 --> 00:31:26,272
这边
This way!

612
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:34,736
锁住了
It's locked!

613
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:35,648
是条死路
It's a dead end.

614
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:37,817
不 不 不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no. No. No, no, no, no.

615
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:39,258
拉马尔
Ramal?

616
00:31:43,687 --> 00:31:44,620
藏起来
Hide! Hide!

617
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,000
我不想杀你 只杀你朋友
I don't want to kill you! Just your friends.

618
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,950
-明白了吗  -锡德 你还活着吗
- You understand? - Sid, you're alive?

619
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:53,666
-走着瞧  -拉马尔
- We'll see about that. - Ramal?!

620
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,927
我们去把那龟孙子按倒
Let's hand the son of a bitch over.

621
00:31:55,949 --> 00:31:57,110
没用的
Won't work.

622
00:31:57,607 --> 00:31:59,396
他们会开枪把我们打趴下
They'll gun us down anyway.

623
00:31:59,425 --> 00:32:01,730
那我们也不能等死啊
Can't just wait here and die.

624
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,072
游戏结束了
Your game is up.

625
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,716
出来
Come out!

626
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:20,730
无论是谁
Anyone

627
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:24,673
挡在我和阿布·拉马尔中间 都得死
who gets between me and Abu Ramal dies.

628
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,301
明白了吗
You understand?!

629
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:32,552
拉马尔在哪里
Where is Ramal?

630
00:32:33,556 --> 00:32:35,010
马上告诉我
Tell me now!

631
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:40,138
有个男孩
There's a boy.

632
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:43,759
在纽约的伊萨卡岛 叫迈克·斯科菲尔德
Ithaca, New York. Mike Scofield.

633
00:32:44,618 --> 00:32:46,683
万一我没活着出去
If I don't make it out of here alive,

634
00:32:47,127 --> 00:32:49,090
跟他说他爸爸很爱他
tell him his father loves him very much.

635
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:50,887
"他爸爸"
"His father"?

636
00:32:57,461 --> 00:32:59,229
如果我摁不住那把枪
If I don't smother that gun,

637
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:00,829
他们会把我们全杀了
they'll kill us all.

638
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,120
后退
Move back!

639
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,749
后退 快走
Move back! Go!

640
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,025
让我过去
Let me through!

641
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,010
迈克尔 迈克尔
Michael! Michael!

642
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:17,853
迈克尔 迈克尔
Michael? Michael!

643
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:37,483
波塞冬派你来的吗
Poseidon sent you?

644
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:38,800
你朋友呢
Where's your friend?

645
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,218
早就走远了
He's long gone.

646
00:34:40,443 --> 00:34:41,810
后门那边
Back door.

647
00:34:43,512 --> 00:34:44,610
从里面反锁了
Locked from the inside.

648
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:45,480
他在里面
He's in here.

649
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,378
找到他
Find him.

650
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,272
以前我也和你一样 为了谎言杀生
I was you once, killing for a lie.

651
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:53,483
那你现在呢
Now you're what?

652
00:34:53,498 --> 00:34:55,265
为真相而死吗
Dying for the truth?

653
00:34:56,065 --> 00:34:58,145
寻找真相是人的本性
It's human nature to find stuff out,

654
00:34:58,625 --> 00:34:59,985
你也会这样的
so you will.

655
00:35:01,214 --> 00:35:02,669
或者她会找到
Or she will.

656
00:35:03,454 --> 00:35:06,625
然后谎言一方会来杀死知情者
And then the lie has to kill the truth.

657
00:35:08,087 --> 00:35:10,436
下一个死的会是...
Which one of you is gonna die ne...?

658
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:34,530
没时间了
Time to get scarce.

659
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:36,560
嘿
Hey!

660
00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:44,080
他对你说了什么
What did he say to you?

661
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,254
没什么
Nothing.

662
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,040
离汽车店还有好几个街区
Auto shop's a few blocks up.

663
00:36:19,505 --> 00:36:21,141
你的人最好正在赶来
And your men better be coming.

664
00:36:21,149 --> 00:36:22,094
他们会来的
They will be there.

665
00:36:22,101 --> 00:36:23,418
贾在哪里
Where is Ja?

666
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:29,956
贾
Ja,

667
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,014
-你在干嘛  -兄弟 我饿死了
- What are you doing? - I'm starving, man.

668
00:36:32,014 --> 00:36:33,832
你知道我有多久没见过水果了吗
You know how long it's been since I seen fruit?

669
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,580
你停下来吃东西
You're stopping to eat?

670
00:36:35,616 --> 00:36:36,982
你嗑药了啊
Are you high?!

671
00:36:37,527 --> 00:36:39,476
别骂我 你又不是我妈
Don't come at me, man. You're not my mama.

672
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,421
知道吗 你完了
You know what? You're done.

673
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,738
-你出局了  -什么
- You're gone. - What?

674
00:36:43,738 --> 00:36:46,290
-等下  -我说了 走 你是个累赘
- Wait. - I said, walk! You're a liability!

675
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:49,789
等等等等 你说了你要带我出去
Wait. Wait. You said you'd get me out,

676
00:36:49,781 --> 00:36:51,774
带我回家 我们说好了的
all the way home. That was the deal.

677
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,327
拉马尔 要是这个人再跟着我们
Ramal, this man follows us,

678
00:36:56,356 --> 00:36:57,512
跟你的人说 开枪打死他
tell your men to shoot him.

679
00:36:57,527 --> 00:36:58,800
很乐意
Gladly.

680
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,752
你去哪了 迈克尔
Where'd you go, Michael?

681
00:37:32,945 --> 00:37:34,450
你在哪里
Where'd you go?

682
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,450
你们来了 兄弟们
There you are, my men.

683
00:38:08,472 --> 00:38:10,660
抓住这些走狗 我们就能把他们干掉了
Seize these dogs so that we can put them down.

684
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,098
拉马尔
Ramal.

685
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:20,581
拉马尔 你在做什么
Ramal, what are you doing?

686
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:24,000
你以为你骗到我了吗
You thought you tricked me?

687
00:38:24,487 --> 00:38:28,894
我们绕远路
Take the long way around while your friend...

688
00:38:30,872 --> 00:38:33,330
好让你朋友先到这里拿到武器
gets here first to get weapons.

689
00:38:34,203 --> 00:38:36,880
你想玩我 这是美国俚语吧
You were going to screw me. That's the American slang.

690
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,332
-不是吗  -是你想玩我
- Isn't it? - You were gonna screw me.

691
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:41,920
无话可说
So much for our word.

692
00:38:42,203 --> 00:38:43,927
对敌人撒谎
Lying to enemies.

693
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:46,261
伊斯兰教称之为拓奇雅
It's called Taqiyya.

694
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,470
相机拿出来
Take off the camera.

695
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:52,316
我要让世界知道
I will show the world

696
00:38:52,734 --> 00:38:54,550
对阿布·拉马尔不敬
what happens

697
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,796
会是什么下场
when you screw Abu Ramal.

698
00:38:58,712 --> 00:38:59,672
跪下
On your knees!

699
00:38:59,701 --> 00:39:02,021
-不可能  -让他们跪下
- It's not gonna happen. - Make them on their knees!

700
00:39:22,218 --> 00:39:23,170
住手
Enough!

701
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:26,385
放下你们的武器
Drop your weapons.

702
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,083
离我弟弟远点儿
Step away from my brother.

703
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,360
林肯
Linc.

704
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,498
你有多爱你的弟弟
How much do you love this brother of yours?

705
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:51,309
你为什么不从车上下来
Why don't you step down from that truck?

706
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,763
停 停 停 事情不太对
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. No, it's not going down

707
00:39:54,763 --> 00:39:56,510
听我说 好吗

-退后  -我入狱
-Step back! -I went to prison for killing

710
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:04,029

a guy in a bar fight. I didn't even want

711
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:06,894
我本来根本不想卷入事端 他开始对我女朋友言语不干净
to get into it, okay? He starts talking yang to my girl.

712
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:07,978
我叫他走开
I tell him to beat it.

713
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,967
他拿出一把刀 我突然大怒
He pulls a knife, and I see red.

714
00:40:11,323 --> 00:40:12,510
一秒之后
One second later,

715
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,363
我就拿着他滴血的刀 把他按在地上
I'm holding his bloody knife, and it's his body on the ground.

716
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,778
-你没有这么快  -一秒
- You're not that fast. - One second.

别这么做
Please don't do this.

718
00:40:20,676 --> 00:40:22,429
你打不过的
You will lose.

听你朋友的话
Listen to your friend.

720
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,900
我是在跟你说 拉马尔

我说了 从车上下来

把你们的武器拣起来
Pick up your weapons!

723
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:34,010
在你意识到之前 只有一秒钟反应时间
You've got one second till that one second happens.

724
00:40:34,051 --> 00:40:35,651
去死吧
Go to hell.

725
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,389
来了更多人了
We got more coming!

726
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,392
-这边还有  -糟糕了
- And more over here! - This is a big problem.

727
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,270
我们快离开这鬼地方
Let's get the hell out of here.

728
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,261
-你想见我们  -哎哟
- You wanted to see us? - Ouch.

729

Come on. Come on.

730
00:41:57,207 --> 00:41:59,250
看看这反派
Behold the villain.

731
00:42:12,087 --> 00:42:14,203
他到底是谁
Who the hell is this guy?

我不敢相信
I can't believe this.

735
00:42:25,236 --> 00:42:28,189
我不敢相信 简直不可思议
I just can't believe this. I can't believe this.

736
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,330
你怎么又进监狱了
Back at the prison. Why?

737
