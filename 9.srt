1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,460
- 越狱前情提要  - 我们找到迈克尔了
- Previously on Prison Break... - We found Michael.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,320
我没想到还能见到这张面孔
Never thought I'd see this face again.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,840
你本来不应该见到的
You weren't supposed to.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,990
你属于我  斯科菲尔德  不管你在计划什么
I own you, Scofield. If you're planning something,

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,260
我总会先你一步
I'll always be a step ahead of you.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,770
你的丈夫
Your husband.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,100
雅各布就是波塞冬
Jacob is Poseidon.

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,760
他是为CIA探员
He's a CIA operative,

9
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,080
潜伏得很深
deep cover.

10
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,070
他负责一个名叫21空室的分裂机构
He runs a splinter cell called 21-Void.

11
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,270
他因为我的技能选中了我
He targeted me for my skills.

12
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,610
四年前  他背叛了我从而占有你
Four years ago, he betrayed me so he could have you.

13
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,530
- 他是怎么背叛你的  - 我们当时
- How did he betray you? - We were meeting a man

14
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,630
见了一位叫哈兰・盖因斯的人
named Harlan Gaines,

15
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,580
他是中情局的副局长
a deputy director of the CIA.

16
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,950
那天晚上波塞冬射杀了盖因斯
Poseidon shot and killed Gaines that night.

17
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,690
我知道自己被下了套
I knew I was being set up.

18
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,550
迈克尔  现在他和我们的儿子在一起
Michael, he's with our son right now.

19
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,420
斯科菲尔德在寻找同伴  梳理监狱人员
Scofield was looking for a partner, combing prisons,

20
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,860
想找一个能够应付他的人
looking for someone who could handle himself.

21
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,430
你想跟我说什么
What are you trying to tell me?

22
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,620
这些在你身上根深蒂固  你是从我这里继承的  儿砸
It was ingrained in you, son. You got it from me.

23
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,030
通过屏幕抓取获得了他通过网络电话从沙漠传送出来的图像
Screen grab of the Skype transmission he sent from the desert.

24
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,820
有那么多中加密的方式  为什么选择这个
Of all things to encrypt, why that?

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,660
这件事结束后我就与21空室毫无瓜葛
I'm done with 21-Void after this.

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,030
加入了21空室就没有退出这一说 范
There's no leaving 21-Void, Van.

27
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,210
不妨把嘴闭上  把钱给我  博罗斯
How about you just shut up and pay me, Burrows?

28
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,380
我没钱
I don't have it.

29
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,950
你知道我是谁吗
You know who I am?

30
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,880
我会帮你和你妈妈逃出去的
I'm gonna get you and your mother out of here.

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,530
我们得快点离开了
We need to run.

32
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:19,260
六分钟前

33
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,210
你知道你是个精神变态者吗
Do you know that you're a psychopath?

34
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,250
我向你保证  我绝不是唯一一个向自己的家人
I assure you, I'm not the first CIA man to hide his life

35
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,590
隐藏自己生活的中情局人员
from his family.

36
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,120
你向中情局掩盖了其存在
You hid it from the CIA.

37
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,130
听着  如果你想搞砸一件事
Look, you want to screw something up?

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,220
那就让一堆人去搞  你想成事
Put a thousand people on it. You want to get it done right?

39
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,110
交给几个人去负责  我们所做的一切  
Put it in the hands of a few. What we were doing

40
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,530
是为了推动这个国家的进步
was advancing this country's cause.

41
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,590
释放像 阿布・拉玛尔这样的人
How does freeing a man like Abu Ramal

42
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,000
怎么能推动国家的进步
advance this country's cause?

43
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,530
这个并不能
Well, it doesn't.

44
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,070
之前的任务
The missions before,

45
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,810
都是为了这个国家的利益着想  但是
they were for the good of the country, but...

46
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,410
这个任务不是为了国家
No, this one wasn't about country.

47
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,580
这是为了你
It was about you.

48
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,590
没人想要孤独终老  萨拉
Nobody wants to die to their old life, Sara.

49
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,750
迈克尔也不想
And Michael didn't.

50
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,860
他孤注一掷地想要留在你身边
He wanted to hold on to it so desperately.

51
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,660
在那一刻  我想要
In that moment, I wanted him

52
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,840
让他走开
to go away,

53
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,300
整个协议
the whole agreement,

54
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,400
都只是为了占有你
and just have you.

55
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,330
你把他派到也门去送死
You sent him to Yemen to die.

56
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,490
我不断说服我自己将是我所说的最后一个谎言
Kept telling myself this was gonna be my last lie.

57
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,080
一切都会随着时间的流逝  我们婚礼的举行
That it would fade with time as we had anniversaries,

58
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,980
以及抚养孩子的过程慢慢褪去
raised that beautiful child.

59
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,650
那不是你的孩子
That is not your child.

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,210
是我把他养大的
I raised him.

61
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,410
这份感情是真的
That love is real.

62
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,550
这不是个谎言
It's not a lie.

63
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,080
你把他当作诱饵
You are using him as bait.

64
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,420
你这个人渣
You son of a bitch.

65
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,920
她知道不能伤到他
She knows not to hurt him.

66
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,090
你是如此痴迷于解决迈克尔
You were so obsessed with Michael

67
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,260
以致于你要拿我的儿子去冒险
that you would risk my son!

68
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,260
迈克尔  你是在说你吧
Michael? You mean you.

69
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,260
你并不爱我  那都是你的自负在作祟
You don't love me. Your ego's too big.

70
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,600
你忙着成为房间里最聪明的人怎么会有心思管我
You're too busy trying to be the smartest man in the room.

71
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,900
然后你遇到了我的丈夫
And then you met my husband,

72
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,330
然后你意识到
and you realized

73
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,640
他比你聪明
he's smarter than you.

74
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,310
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

75
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,200
你确定吗
You sure?

76
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,110
我确定
I'm positive.

77
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,140
我们之间的感情是真的  萨拉
Our love was real, Sara.

78
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,260
那都是过去式了
Past tense.

79
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,620
我还爱着你
I still love you.

80
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,850
一切准备就绪  老板
Everything's set, boss.

81
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,240
很好
Good.

82
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,760
不得不夸奖你
Got to give you credit.

83
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,840
不辞辛劳地为一个人
You'll go the whole nine yards to help one man

84
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,100
窃取另一个人的妻子
steal another man's wife.

85
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,330
不  不  不  别和她说话
No, no, no. Don't talk to him.

86
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,070
否则会怎样  他还能
Or what? He'll do something

87
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,170
对我做些什么  你反正要杀了我
you're not already gonna do? You're going to kill me.

88
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,750
不管你之前说了多少次我爱你
No matter how many times you tell me you love me first.

89
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,560
闭嘴
Shut up!

90
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,670
迈克尔没有杀哈兰・盖因斯  他没有动机
Michael didn't kill Harlan Gaines. He had no motive.

91
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,380
- 闭嘴  - 他才是那个有动机的人
- Shut up. - He's the one with the motive.

92
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,250
哈兰・盖因斯是你的长官
Harlan Gaines was your CIA director

93
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,850
他之前在调查雅各布
and he was looking into Jacob.

94
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,980
他想要把雅各布关起来
He was gonna put him prison.

95
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,220
该死
Damn it!

96
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,060
把她的嘴用胶带封上
Tape her mouth shut, please.

97
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,810
封死
Tape it shut.

98
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,860
如果你这么做了  一个无辜的人会死
If you do, an innocent man dies,

99
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,430
而真凶会逍遥法外
and the real killer walks.

100
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,950
你还不明白吗
Don't you understand?

101
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,080
是雅各布杀了哈兰・盖因斯
Jacob killed Harlan Gaines.

102
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,890
闭嘴
Just shut it.

103
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,850
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem?

104
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,310
他来了  是时候了
Here he comes. It's time to do this.

105
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,060
十分钟后这个地方会被烧毁
This place is gonna burn down in ten minutes.

106
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,060
如果能给你点慰藉的话
And if it's any solace,

107
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,700
我可以告诉你我们的儿子不是其中之一
our son won't be one of them.

108
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,870
山中无老虎  猴子称大王
While the cat's away, the mice will play.

109
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,870
事情不太对劲
Something's wrong.

110
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,990
我得到了你的地图
I got your map.

111
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,130
我会把你和妈妈救出去的
I'm gonna get you and your mother out of here.

112
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,280
地图不是我画的
I didn't draw a map.

113
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,440
我们得快点走了
We need to run.

114
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,310
等一下
Wait.

115
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,050
你上来做什么  范
What are you doing up here, Van?

116
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,150
我只是想确定我们抓对人了
I just want to make sure that we're getting the right guy.

117
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,750
问他几个问题
Ask him some questions.

118
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,290
放我儿子走
Let my son go.

119
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,460
我任你们处置
Do whatever you want with me.

120
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,060
放我儿子走
Just let my son go.

121
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,500
命令里没有包括问问题
Orders weren't to ask questions.

122
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,930
命令是当场击毙
It was to shoot on sight.

123
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,770
也许我们应该问问题  
Maybe we should ask questions, damn it.

124
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,880
如果斯科菲尔德杀了哈兰・盖因斯
If Scofield killed Harlan Gaines,

125
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,810
如果有必要的话  我们带他去警局
we take him to the police, if we have to.

126
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,010
我们通过合法的途径来处理
We get this done the right way.

127
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,650
波塞冬不会放过我们的
Poseidon would never let us live.

128
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,080
他不会找到我们的
He won't find us.

129
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,690
我跟你说  如果我们想消失  没人能找得到
I told you. We want to disappear, we disappear.

130
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
我可以做到
I can make that happen.

131
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,530
我把他交给警察
We turn him in,

132
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,760
我们就可以远走高飞
and we're gone.

133
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,530
别逼我这样做抉择
Don't make me choose like this.

134
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,730
艾米莉
Emily.

135
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,630
这真的有的选吗
Is it really even a choice?

136
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,430
不
No.

137
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,800
因为没有退出21空室这一说
'Cause there's no leaving 21-Void.

138
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,350
快走
Go.

139
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,980
你的叔叔就在车道尽头
Your uncle's at the end of the driveway.

140
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,580
别回头  快跑  快
Don't turn around. Run! Go!

141
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,690
萨拉
Sara.

142
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,260
我们的孩子呢
Where's our boy?

143
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,730
林肯叔叔  林肯叔叔
Uncle Lincoln, Uncle Lincoln!

144
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,330
- 不  不  不  是我  - 出什么事了 
- No, no, no, it's me. - What's going on?

145
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,330
他们在开枪  我好害怕
They're shooting. I'm scared.

146
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,980
- 好的  他们想要抓你  - 谁
- Okay. They've come for you. - Who?

147
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,570
我不会让他们伤害你的
I am not gonna let them hurt you,

148
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,170
你们明白吗  快上车
you understand? Get in the car.

149
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,970
不  我们现在得走了  小迈  该走了
No, we've got to go now, Mike. We've got to go.

150
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,930
那妈妈怎么办
What about my mom?

151
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,000
先进去  快
Go, go, go.

152
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,240
小迈  不要
Mike! No!

153
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,280
不
No!

154
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,240
别走
No!

155
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,410
小迈
Mike!

156
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,350
他抢走了他
He took him.

157
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,980
- 萨拉  - 他抢走了我们儿子
- Sara... - He took our son.

158
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,120
别去了  我们回去  宝贝
Come back to me. Come back to me, sweetheart.

159
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,380
到我这来
Come back to me.

160
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,900
我们得集中注意力  好吗
We got to stay focused, all right?

161
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,790
这事没完  不会这么快解决的
This is not over. Not by a long shot.

162
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,190
- 林肯呢  - 什么
- Where's Linc? - What?

163
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,290
我们得找到林肯
We got to find Linc, okay?

164
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,660
先找林肯
We're gonna find Linc.

165
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,300
林肯
Linc.

166
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,330
我的天
Oh my God.

167
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,540
林肯  林肯
Linc. Linc.

168
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,500
我让你失望了  迈克尔
I let you down, Michael.

169
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,460
我本来有机会就该除掉卢卡的
I should have taken care of Luca when I had the chance.

170
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,840
你没让我失望  你也预料不到
You didn't let me down. You couldn't have known.

171
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,510
因为你我们才能差点救回小迈  林肯
We're so close because of you, Linc.

172
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,910
你把我带回了家
You got me home.

173
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,350
是你
You got me home.

174
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,880
医生给他打了镇定剂  迈克尔
They've stabilized him, Michael.

175
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,320
我们帮不上忙
There's nothing we can do.

176
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,520
我得带你尽快离开这里
We've got to get you out of here right now.

177
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,740
你得给我些指示什么的
Okay, you got to give me some direction here, you know?

178
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,440
一些
Some, um...

179
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,980
父亲的建议
fatherly advice

180
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:36,780
教教我如何处理和你这样的父亲的
on how to deal with having a father that's, um...

181
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,090
关系
you.

182
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,860
就是
Well, you know, uh...

183
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,270
这事对于你我来说都不容易接受
Is this blood freaking you out like it's freaking me out?

184
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,830
是的
Yeah, yeah. Let me, uh...

185
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,200
斯考菲尔德说父子关系能拯救你我
Scofield said that it would deliver me. Both of us.

186
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,370
我只需要
All I have to do

187
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,210
给他父爱
is just get it to him.

188
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,880
就可以理解了
I understand why.

189
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,160
现在我终于明白了
So I can finally understand this.

190
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,290
他给了你这个
He give you this?

191
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,760
执你之手
"By your hand, you shall know

192
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,260
共享天棱之乐
the glories of your progeny..."

193
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,660
那  那是
I-It's, it's...

194
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,300
天伦之乐  傻孩子
It's "progeny," dear boy.

195
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,560
天伦之乐
"Progeny.

196
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,960
我们的世界将永远回归正途
And our world will be made right forevermore."

197
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,620
一开始  我以为这和宗教有关
Originally, I thought it was a religious thing.

198
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,240
上帝之子什么的
You know, son of God, and all that.

199
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,970
但现在我知道
But now I know it's...

200
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:37,110
是指我的儿子
it's my own progeny.

201
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,550
你
You.

202
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,290
确实是天伦之乐
It's a glorious thing indeed.

203
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,660
即使我他妈不知道如何处理父子关系
Even if I don't have a damn clue how to deal with it.

204
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,100
你我彼此彼此
You and me both.

205
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,420
我有一个找回
I've got a way to get

206
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,370
我们儿子的办法  萨拉
our son back, Sara.

207
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,270
我从雅各布一开始让我离开
I've been planning to bring Jacob down

208
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:12,180
你和小迈开始就计划打倒他
ever since he forced me to turn my back on you and Mike.

209
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,450
因为我一直被关在也门监狱
A plan I had to put on hold

210
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,950
所以计划未能执行
while I was in that Yemeni prison.

211
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,150
我必须等到逃出来才能施行
I had to wait till I got out.

212
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,620
直到所有所有事情归位
Till everything aligned.

213
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,800
直到现在
Till now.

214
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,600
请告诉我你们找到线索了
Tell me you got something.

215
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,150
它在抗拒我
It's eluding me.

216
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,320
眼睛纹身的代码比我编的更强大
There's an even bigger code encrypted into the eyes.

217
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,890
你读出了什么
And what's it say?

218
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,890
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

219
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,210
但是以我使用的处理技术
But with the amount of processing power I throw at it,

220
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,170
很快我们就会找出答案了
we're gonna find out real soon.

221
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,310
怎么了
What's wrong?

222
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,010
我  我不知道怎么和你说
I-I don't know how to say it, so, um...

223
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,220
刚才那个人是个警察
That man was a police detective,

224
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,020
他告诉我你妈
and he told me your moth...

225
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,690
你妈妈死了
your mother's dead.

226
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,090
什么
What?

227
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,020
我知道  别难过
I know. I know.

228
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,390
但我会带你到安全的地方
But I'm gonna take you somewhere safe,

229
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,660
这样那些坏人就
where those people that are trying to hurt you

230
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,130
害不到你了
can't reach you.

231
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,430
为什么他们要害我
Why would they try and hurt me?

232
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,470
因为我爱你
It's because I love you.

233
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,130
他们想以此来让我难过
And they're trying to hurt me...

234
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,620
夺走我唯一所爱
Take the one thing that I truly love away.

235
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,820
为什么他么要伤害你
Why would they try and hurt you?

236
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,710
因为有些关于我的事情
Because there are some things

237
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,850
我还没和你说
I haven't told you about me.

238
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,450
我给你发那封信是有原因的
I sent that letter to you for a reason.

239
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,490
波塞冬在监控我与每一个
Poseidon was monitoring my communications

240
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,650
潜在的线人  或者同伴
with everyone who could possibly be a resource

241
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,260
之间的通讯  却并不监控我和
or an ally, but not with people

242
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,360
讨厌的人的联系
I despised.

243
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,400
你就直说吧  你到底怎么想我的
Give it to me straight... How you really feel about me?

244
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,310
我想如果我对一个
I figured if I showed grace to a man

245
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,930
从未受过恩会的人做点好事
who'd never seen it before in his life,

246
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,200
他也许会很感激
maybe he'd be grateful,

247
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,810
愿意帮我们一把
do something for us.

248
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,700
帮我们所有人
All of us,

249
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,810
包括他自己
himself included.

250
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,350
我们的生活将永远重回正轨
"And our lives shall be made right forevermore."

251
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,580
我的意思是普通的  日常生活
I'm talking about normal, everyday life.

252
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,370
得到我们大家很久很久没有体会过的哪种自由
The kind of freedom none of us has known in a long, long time.

253
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,060
但波塞冬不会轻易放过我们
But Poseidon's not just gonna let us go.

254
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,280
他紧紧控制了
He's got me and your son

255
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,720
我和你儿子
in an iron grip.

256
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,680
必须有人让他放手
Someone has to make him let go.

257
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,630
你明白了吗
Do you understand?

258
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,530
我跟上你的思路了
I'm tracking where you're going.

259
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,870
我们能回归那种
Only way we're gonna get

260
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,770
你口中说的
that beautiful, mundane life

261
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,180
美好又平凡的生活的唯一办法
you're talking... Any of us...

262
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,640
就是我取了他的性命
Is if I take his.

263
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,460
从现在开始我们就安全了
We'll be safe here for now.

264
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,120
听着
Hey, listen,

265
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,640
我承诺过会向你解释的
I promised I'd explain.

266
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,510
那些人追杀我的原因是
The reason those people are after me...

267
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,620
我知道很难让你相信
I know this is gonna be hard to believe,

268
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:26,890
但我差不多是个特工
but I'm basically a secret agent.

269
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,570
进来
Come on in.

270
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,040
你还记得你在后院里的堡垒吗
You know that fort you've got in the backyard?

271
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,310
来到一个更大的堡垒感觉不错吧
It feels good to go somewhere like that, right?

272
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,950
一个无人知道的地方  没人能伤到你
A place no one knows about, where no one can get to you.

273
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,950
这就是我的安全堡垒
Well, that's what this place is for me.

274
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,490
没事的
It's okay.

275
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,720
别害怕
It's okay.

276
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,790
你可以出示
Would you please show him

277
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,030
你的证件吗  布莱克特工
your credentials, Agent Blake?

278
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,600
艾米丽・布莱克特工  CIA
Agent Emily Blake, CIA.

279
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,800
关于你家门口发生的悲剧
I'm sorry that had to happen

280
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,830
我感到很抱歉
in front of you at the house.

281
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,600
她被派去监视我们家保护你
She was stationed at the house to protect you...

282
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,100
让你免受那个最终会出现
from exactly the man who ended up coming,

283
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,420
自称是你父亲
the man who said

284
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,810
的人的伤害
he was your dad.

285
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,380
真的吗
Really?

286
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,890
这些年我为了保护美国树了不少敌人
I've made enemies defending America over the years.

287
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,460
最糟糕的是
Worst part is that this

288
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,160
这个坏人又激起了你对你父亲的会议
particular one dredged up the memory of your father.

289
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,960
事实上  小迈
The truth is, Mikey,

290
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,240
不管你如何想  你父亲七年前就
despite what you may want to believe, your father died

291
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,900
死了
seven years ago.

292
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,010
喂
Yeah.

293
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,310
我是迈克尔・斯考菲尔德
This is Michael Scofield.

294
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,850
我们正在谈论你
We were just talking about you.

295
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,480
我给你最后一个拯救自己的机会
I'm giving you one last chance to save your life.

296
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,350
把我儿子还给我  否则我不保证接下来
Hand the boy over or I can't be held responsible

297
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,720
你会承受什么后果
for what happens next.

298
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,140
你是在威胁我吗
Are you threatening my life?

299
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,930
我说的只是你不照做的下场
Only if you don't hand him over.

300
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,490
我绝不会把我的儿子交给你
I'd never hand over my son.

301
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,260
他从来就不是你的儿子
He's not your son and never was.

302
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,200
离我爸爸远点
Stay away from my dad,

303
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,830
你听见了吗
you hear?

304
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,870
走开
Stay away!

305
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,070
好孩子
Good boy.

306
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,390
他喊他爸爸
He called him Dad.

307
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,020
雅各布
Jacob.

308
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,200
不  他只是给他洗脑了而已
No, he's-he's brainwashing him, that's all.

309
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,590
你说得对  像那样的人
Man like that, you're right.

310
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,330
他应该去死
He deserves to die.

311
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,500
他在哪里
Where is he?

312
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,600
波塞冬在哪
Where is Poseidon?

313
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,870
会有人处理他的
He'll be dealt with.

314
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,870
等一下  等一下
Wait, hang on, hang on, hang on, man.

315
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,610
如果你被捕了
If you get caught...

316
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,810
如果他被抓了  他就得回到监狱里去
If he gets caught, he's going back to the pen.

317
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,180
- 来吧  - 我不能
- Come on, come on. - I'm not...

318
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,580
如果我不那么做呢
And if I don't do it?

319
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,480
老天  我只是想让你干干净净的
Criminy, I want you free and clear,

320
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,880
如果只有一条路能实现我的目标
and if that's the only way to do it,

321
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,050
那我一定会义无反顾的那么做
then I got to be the one that does it.

322
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,180
斯科菲尔德就不会那么做
Scofield ain't gonna do it.

323
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,450
他没有杀戮基因
He don't got the killing gene.

324
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,820
没有人会被抓住
No one is getting caught.

325
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,630
我有我的特殊计划
There's a very specific order to this.

326
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,490
萨拉  我需要你确保
Sara, I want you to make sure

327
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,530
林肯的安全  让他不要受伤
Linc's safe and out of harm's way.

328
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,400
鞭子和T-bag  你们负责给我们提供一张王牌
Whip, T-Bag, you're gonna collect a wild card for us.

329
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,200
一个雅各布所不了解的东西
One that Jacob doesn't know is out there.

330
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,320
我得先去个地方  这一切开始的地方
I'm gonna go to the nest, where this all started,

331
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,510
藏匿秘密的地方
where the secrets lay hidden,

332
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,910
血泪终将流淌在属于它们的地方
and where blood will finally be spilled in its rightful place.

333
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,910
我刚才从斯科菲尔德那里接到一通电话
The call I just got from Scofield...

334
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,820
我想知道是从哪打来的
I want to know where it came from.

335
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,420
定位数据
Location data

336
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,960
马上发送给你
coming to you right now.

337
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,760
不知道是什么地方
Middle of nowhere.

338
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,960
向东北方向移动  并且挂断电话
Started moving northeast and the phone was shut off.

339
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,100
或者扔了
Maybe tossed.

340
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,840
你和那个该死的动物园  斯科菲尔德
You and your damn zoo, Scofield.

341
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,490
我会全部弄清楚
I'm gonna find out once and for all

342
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,340
你到底在那里搞什么鬼
what you were really doing there.

343
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,110
你到底在计划着什么
What you were really planning.

344
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,260
然后我会亲手杀了你
And then I'm gonna kill you.

345
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,260
我了解你的所有
I know everything about you.

346
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,300
甚至是你平庸的举措
Even your most mundane actions.

347
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,830
就像这个动物园  到底隐藏着你的什么秘密
Like the zoo. What's with you and the zoo?

348
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,580
我要了解这个人所有的细节
I had to know everything about the man

349
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,720
那个把计划刻在皮肤上的人
who wore his plans on his skin.

350
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,050
一目了然
In plain sight, yet

351
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,900
却如此神秘莫测
so mysterious.

352
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,020
通向绝对的权力只有一条道路
The secret to real power

353
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,220
就是永远不要背叛你的信仰
is to never betray your intentions.

354
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,520
隐藏自己的外在
To wear nothing on your sleeve,

355
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,860
收敛自己的内心
and to never let anyone see your face.

356
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,300
我永远会在你前面一步
I'll always be a step ahead of you.

357
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,440
我可以从你眼中读懂一切
I can see everything in your eyes.

358
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,440
什么
What?

359
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,110
我从你的眼神解谜
I decrypted the code from the eyes.

360
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,080
这是拿破仑的一句名言
It's a quote from Napoleon.

361
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,550
什么名言
What quote?

362
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,120
当你的敌人在犯错的时候
"Never interrupt your enemy

363
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,280
千万不要打断他
when he's making a mistake."

364
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,230
这是那双眼睛里所隐藏的信息
It's what's behind the eyes that counts.

365
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,130
想必你已经知道我正站在你关闭的服务器前面
Thought you should know I'm looking at your closed servers right now.

366
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,600
我手上捏着你的硬盘驱动
I'm holding your hard drives in my hand.

367
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,630
你所有的秘密通讯
All your secret communications.

368
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,440
足够让你一辈子消失了
Enough to send you away forever.

369
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,970
恭喜你  迈克尔
Bravo, Michael.

370
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,510
不管怎么说  恭喜你进到那里面去了
However you got in there, bravo.

371
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,740
你把我引导动物园来  所以你能进到我的办公室
You sent me to the zoo so you could get into

372
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,310
但是你我都知道  你的威胁外强中干
my office. But you and I both know your threat's a hollow one,

373
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,910
因为你知道我手上也有筹码
because you know I've got something

374
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,420
比你的价值更高  你的儿子
that's even more valuable to you: your son.

375
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,180
我们又回到博弈论当中去了
So we're back to game theory.

376
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,950
我们何不谈一个协议
Do we work together, make a trade

377
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,390
让彼此双方从中获利呢
so we both get what we want?

378
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,960
或者你想试试谁的招数更阴吗
Or are you gonna try something underhanded?

379
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,190
你知道我会同意的
You know I will.

380
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,960
我也会  所以我们何不
As will I. So why don't we

381
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,430
忘记过去  实现双赢
cut past that and make a deal?

382
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,110
当然了  迈克尔
Sure, Michael. Yeah,

383
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,070
我们就这么办
let's do that.

384
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,260
老船厂
Old shipyard.

385
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,570
A仓库
Warehouse A.

386
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,930
明天下午五点见
5:00 p.m. tomorrow.

387
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,430
好的
Fine.

388
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,380
打扰一下
Uh, excuse me?

389
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,910
我丈夫的哥哥  林肯・巴罗斯
My brother-in-law... did-did Lincoln Burrows,

390
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,210
他换病房了吗
did he get moved?

391
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,720
没有女士  他自己出院了
No, ma'am. He checked himself out.

392
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,850
- 他流了很多血  - 我知道
- He was down a lot of blood. - I know.

393
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,790
我们试过阻止他  但是如果患者坚持这么做
We tried to stop him, but if a patient insists,

394
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,020
这在他的权利范围之内  我们也没办法
if it's within their power, we have to let 'em go.

395
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,320
这是巴拉德医生
Uh, this is Dr. Ballard.

396
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,790
- 是他做的手术  - 你好
- He did the surgery. - Hi,

397
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,930
萨拉・斯科菲尔德  实际上我之前在伊萨卡岛是个内科医生  
Sara Scofield, I'm an internist, actually, up at Ithaca.

398
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,670
你知道他有可能会去哪里吗
Do you have any idea where my brother-in-law might have gone?

399
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,400
- 不太清楚  - 好吧
- No idea. - Right.

400
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,980
在手指湖发生了什么事
What happened up in Finger Lakes,

401
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,490
你知道吗  另一个枪击案的幸存者
do you know? Another gunshot victim

402
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,390
同一区域 同一时间
came in from the same area

403
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,640
送到我们这里来了
at the same time.

404
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,170
我大伯只是个例  肯定是巧合
My brother-in-law was alone. It must be a coincidence.

405
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,840
但还是谢谢你
But thank you.

406
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,600
我要走了  我已经尽力了
Well, I'm heading out. I've done what I can.

407
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,480
他现在靠三级救助方案在硬撑
He's on life support up on three,

408
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,110
但是坦白讲  我不觉得他能撑到早晨了
but candidly, I don't think he's making it till morning.

409
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,370
卢卡
Luca.

410
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,050
你让我着实逃了一阵子
You had me running there for a bit,

411
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,660
一直在想我是哪里做错了
thinking I'd done something wrong.

412
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,080
你确实错了  你骗了我10万美元
You did. You stiffed me $100 grand.

413
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,950
不  那是脏钱
Nah. It's blood money.

414
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,820
脏钱不能还债
No debts with blood money.

415
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,060
告诉我我们扯平了
Say we're clear.

416
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,230
做梦吧  巴罗斯
Eat me, Burrows.

417
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,940
告诉我扯平了
Say we're clear.

418
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,640
我会带更多人来的
I'm gonna get more guys.

419
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,910
你就继续亡命天涯吧
And you'll be running again.

420
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,480
这次不会
Not this time.

421
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,490
又是你那帮假朋友吗
Are those your fake friends again?

422
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,980
你个王八蛋
You son of a bitch.

423
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,480
这次不是
No. This time,

424
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
这次是真的
they're real.

425
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,690
联邦探员
Federal agents!

426
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,390
把手举到我能看到的地方
Hands where I can see 'em!

427
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,690
- 举起手来  - 巴罗斯
- Hands up! - Burrows!

428
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,860
举起手来
Do it now!

429
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,560
巴罗斯
Burrows!

430
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,670
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

431
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,180
我要找到我的儿子
I need to find my boy.

432
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,620
在这里
Here.

433
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,940
他是一个恶人  抢走了我的儿子
He's an evil man and he's got my son.

434
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,580
你一定认识什么人
You've got to know someone.

435
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,820
知道什么东西
Something.

436
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,910
一些能把我的儿子抢回来的路子
Some way I can get my boy back.

437
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,650
拜托了
Please.

438
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,840
你确定我儿子在这里吗
You sure this is where my son is?

439
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,280
谢谢你
Thank you.

440
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,970
好了
It's all right.

441
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,770
杀戮是不对的
Killing ain't right.

442
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,000
是的  我也读过圣经
Yeah, I read the Bible.

443
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,070
你确定
You did?

444
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,940
你知道吗  我曾经在旅馆房间内扫过一眼
You know, I scanned it once in a hotel room.

445
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,510
你打算怎么做
Well, what you gonna do?

446
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,180
别杀任何人  除非他们真该死
Don't kill anybody unless they really deserve it.

447
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,410
没错  你肯定读过旧约全书了
Yeah, you must've read the Old Testament part.

448
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,970
以眼还眼  以牙还牙
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

449
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,010
当然了 
Sure, whatever.

450
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,320
我就是说说
Yeah, I'm just saying,

451
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,980
有时  王  王八羔子
sometimes, certain... Certain sons of bitches,

452
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,850
需要根除一下他们的旧思想
they just need to be plain old eradicated.

453
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,620
最好让他们在世界上消失
World's just better minus them.

454
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,520
像阿布・拉马尔
Like Abu Ramal.

455
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,890
但最重要的  杀戮是件坏事
But for the most part, you know, killing's just bad.

456
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,490
没错
Yeah, absolutely.

457
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,830
除了波塞冬
Except Poseidon.

458
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,460
- 没错  他是该消失了  - 该消失了
- Yeah, he's got to go, too. - Got to go.

459
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,870
我只是不想你
I just don't want you to get the wrong idea

460
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,130
- 误会我  好吗  - 好
- about me, okay? - Okay.

461
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,240
你得像瑜珈信徒那般看待它  好吗
You got to see it like the yogis, okay?

462
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,410
去其糟粕  取其精华
Destroying the negative to create the positive.

463
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,410
像跳湿婆之舞那样
The dance of the Shivas and all that.

464
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,980
拂去黑暗  让光明重现
Murder the dark, so the... The light can be born.

465
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,250
你要疯狂起来了  是吗
You're out of your damn tree, aren't you?

466
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,450
- 真懂事  - 棒
- Now you know where you got it from. - Great.

467
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,520
蓝色夏威夷在里面吗
Is there a BlueHawaii in there?

468
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,990
是  别磨蹭了  快进来
Yeah, don't just dillydally, come on in.

469
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,230
你美们这两个亡命之徒都是斯科菲尔德的人吗
I assume you two desperados are Scofield's guys.

470
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,160
没错
Yeah.

471
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,150
他也带你们越狱吗
He get you out of prison, too?

472
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,280
不是
No.

473
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,500
但我欠他人情
But I do owe him.

474
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,170
他从哪把你带出来的
Where'd he break you out of?

475
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,470
巴兰基亚市  南美洲
Barranquilla, South America.

476
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,540
像我这样柔弱的小男孩
They were gonna eat my lunch down there,

477
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,540
监狱里的人会把我午餐吃掉
pretty boy like me.

478
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,680
斯科菲尔德同情我
Scofield took pity.

479
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,180
我估计  他看到我身上有的天赋  就带我出来了
Saw a talent in me, I guess. Got me out.

480
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,020
作为回报  他说可能有一天会用上我
Said he might call on those talents some day in return,

481
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,630
所以我就在这了
and now here we are.

482
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,030
我尽快完成这个
Soon as I put the touches on this,

483
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,790
之后我就听你差遣  我一直等得好无聊呀
I'm yours. Got bored waiting.

484
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,430
这很厉害
It's incredible.

485
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,100
还原迪利广场
Rebuild of Dealey Plaza,

486
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,730
肯尼迪遇刺的地方
where JFK was shot.

487
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,600
这里
This here

488
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,030
是一个书库
is a book depository.

489
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,810
如此关注这些小细节
Attention to detail like that,

490
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,940
真是让人疯狂
drive a man crazy.

491
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,840
看看我  就是一个糟老头 
Look at me. I'm a crap house loon.

492
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,280
极度需要把过去
Excessive need to bring the past

493
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,780
在我生命中好好回忆下
back to life.

494
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,650
让它鲜活起来
Make it real.

495
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,950
但是  现在回忆够了
But enough of that.

496
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,260
是时候大干一场了  我说得对吗
Time for the real dance to begin, am I right?

497
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,110
我们会带他回来的  好吗
We're going to get him back, okay?

498
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,540
我们让你的万能牌就位了
We got your wild card ready to go.

499
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,370
谢谢你
Thank you.

500
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,940
我才应该感谢你
Me that should be thanking you.

501
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,340
没有你  就没有今天的我
You brought me all this way.

502
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,610
是我们一起努力的成果
We did it together.

503
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,450
我们会一起并肩作战的
We'll be doing this together.

504
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,850
你给了我家的温暖
You gave me family.

505
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,350
我很感激你
Seriously, thank you.

506
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,620
说到家的话
Speaking of family...

507
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,960
我们走吧
Let's go.

508
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,400
别乱碰  好吗
Don't touch that, please.

509
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,170
现在还不是时候
It's not an option right now.

510
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,000
我的儿子现在在哪
Now where is my son?

511
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,870
你知道你问的问题  我是无论如何
You ask questions you know there isn't a chance in hell

512
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,240
都不会回答的
I'm gonna answer.

513
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,040
那我们接着这个游戏吧
So we're back to the game.

514
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,670
事实是  我们一直都在博弈着
The truth is, we never left.

515
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,240
你手上没有好牌
You're not holding the cards.

516
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,310
- 我才有  - 你有吗
- I am. - Are you?

517
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,180
全世界的执法部门都在找你
Every law agency in the world is looking for you.

518
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,480
你不像是处在有利位置的人
Doesn't sound like a position of power to me.

519
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,120
如果我被捕  服务器里的东西就会发布出去
If I get arrested, those servers will be released,

520
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,290
你做过的所有事  都会公诸于世
and everything you've done will be exposed.

521
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,720
我会找到那些资料  销毁它们
I'll find them. I'll destroy them.

522
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,720
像我说的
Like I said,

523
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,860
我才是拿着一手好牌的那个人
I'm holding the cards.

524
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,130
哇哦
Whoa!

525
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,860
真没想到
Didn't expect that.

526
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,750
这有失你的身份  迈克尔
It's beneath you, Michael.

527
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,930
放他走
Let him go!

528
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,680
我应该想到的
Now that, I expected.

529
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,880
谢谢
Thank you.

530
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,650
放下枪怎么样  美女
How about we drop it, lady?

531
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,920
你以为我没预料到这境况吗
You don't think I expected this?

532
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,850
我们可以一天都玩这个
We could do this all day.

533
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,990
剧情反转再反转
Play contingency after contingency.

534
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,550
但你真的想这样下去吗
But do you really want to do that?

535
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,360
不  大卫  该死
No! David. Dammit!

536
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,730
后退  否则我现在就杀了他
Back off, or I kill him right now.

537
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,150
这肯定是
And that must be

538
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,300
你最后一次的剧情反转了
the last of your contingencies.

539
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,370
感谢你上演的好戏  迈克尔
Thank you so much for showing me, Michael.

540
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,870
太棒了
Oh, yeah.

541
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,170
你该料到我联系了联邦调查局
You should also know I called the FBI.

542
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,680
小道消息说
An anonymous tip saying

543
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,150
科尼尔・奥提斯会出现在这个货仓
that Kaniel Outis would be at this warehouse.

544
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,840
确认安全  现正向第二指定点移动
Keep clear. Moving to second position.

545
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,240
听着
Okay,

546
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,270
他们已经进来了  没时间了
they're in the building. There's no more time.

547
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,980
交出硬盘来  否则我们开枪
The hard drives, or we'll start shooting

548
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,280
- 把你打成渣渣  - 把那男孩
- your pieces. - Hand over

549
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,280
交出来
the damn boy!

550
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,250
闭嘴
Shut up.

551
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,480
美女  你放下枪  转身离开
Lady, put the gun down, walk away,

552
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,480
因为我不会为接下来发生的一切负责
as I cannot be held accountable for what's about to happen.

553
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,050
- 他敢动  就开枪  - 我曾在酒吧打架时
- He moves, shoot him! - I killed a guy

554
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,750
杀了一个人  他当时在调戏我女友
in a bar fight once. He was taking yang to my girl.

555
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,360
- 一秒搞定  我眼都不眨  - 别说了
- Took me one second to do it. - Don't do it!

556
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,090
听他的  他是非常聪明的家伙
Listen to him. He's a very smart man.

557
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,290
我在说你  鞭子
I'm talking to you, Whip.

558
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,160
不值得你为此牺牲  这是我的事
It's not worth dying for. This is my fight!

559
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,430
这是我们的事  我们大费周章地
This is our fight. We've come too far to let this

560
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,330
来让这家伙得逞
son of a bitch win.

561
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,630
这不在我们计划中
This wasn't the plan!

562
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,540
你闭嘴
Don't do it!

563
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,800
王八羔子们就应该消失
Some sons of bitches just got to go!

564
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,100
我们只是做了该做的
We're the only ones who could do it.

565
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,510
- 我没说错吧  老爹  - 大卫
- Ain't that right, Pa? - David!

566
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,680
你就试试
Try me.

567
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,480
鞭子
Whip!

568
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,320
不
No!

569
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,360
- 鞭子  鞭子  - 不
- Whip. Whip. - No.

570
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,460
振作起来  鞭子
Come on. Whip.

571
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,160
事情不该是这样的
This wasn't the plan.

572
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,000
大卫  振作点
David, stay with me.

573
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,430
振作点  兔崽子  振作点
Stay with me, boy. Stay with me.

574
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,170
硬盘  交出来
The hard drives. Now.

575
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,510
我看着他  没事  让我来
I got him. It's okay, I got him.

576
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,720
没事的
All right.

577
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,790
在那边
It's that way.

578
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,620
冷静点  伙计
Keep it calm, boy.

579
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,320
- 保持冷静  - 如果他也想逞英雄的话
- Stay calm. - If he tries to play hero, too,

580
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,370
解决他
execute him.

581
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,770
大卫
David...

582
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,740
你竟敢开枪射他  你这个贱人
You shot him, you bitch.

583
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,240
他不应该挑衅我的
He shouldn't have tried me.

584
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,180
- 大卫  - 别动  举起手
- David... - Hands up! Freeze!

585
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,010
现在举起手  我们是联邦特工
Do it now! Federal agents!

586
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,960
我们是联邦特工
Federal agents!

587
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,560
举起来  让我看到你的手
Hands where I can see them!

588
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,630
我
I'm...

589
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,600
我没事  让我
I'm good. I got to s...

590
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,730
看看你的脸
see your face.

591
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,600
别动  举起手
Freeze! Get your hands up!

592
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,020
安息吧  兔崽子
Go easy, son.

593
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,720
我们接下来要做什么
How we doing?

594
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,630
嘿
Hey.

595
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,290
我比你做的好
Better than you.

596
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,180
哦  感谢上帝
Oh, thank God.

597
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,080
你还好吗
You okay?

598
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,450
哦
Oh.

599
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,260
向前走  在下一个吊窗那里
Up ahead, in the next bay.

600
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,790
我要接个电话
I'll take that call.

601
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,270
我们找到他了  小迈克  我们找到了我们的孩子
We got him, Michael. We got our boy.

602
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,740
是个好消息
Good news for you.

603
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,850
但现在你没有理由能给我我想要的
But now you've got no reason to give me what I want.

604
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,820
这对你来说是个坏消息
Which kind of makes it bad news for you.

605
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,150
联邦特工
Federal agents!

606
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,150
你这个狗娘养的
You son of a bitch.

607
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,690
这个小屋
The cabin.

608
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,330
盖恩斯的夹克
Gaines' jacket.

609
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,450
摄像头  用来拍我的照片
Camera, taking my picture.

610
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,110
空的手枪
Blanks.

611
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,380
你故意想要我把枪从你那里拿回来
You wanted me to take the gun from you back there.

612
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,270
你比我想象的厉害多了
You're better than I thought.

613
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:04,520
为我真正犯下的罪行重新定义
Re-framing me for the murder I actually committed.

614
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,730
你陷害我杀了那个人
The one you framed me for.

615
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,090
迈克  处理那个尸体    
Michael, pick up the body,

616
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,600
让它看起来从未发生过
make it look like it never happened.

617
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,630
你是天才  真的
Genius, really.

618
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,420
但是没人会再次调查那个案件
But no one will ever go for it.

619
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,960
真理是你所告诉人们的一切
The truth is whatever you tell people it is.

620
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,910
是你教会我的
You taught me that.

621
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,140
哦  太糟糕了  联邦调查局会到这里来
Oh. Too bad the feds'll be here

622
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,680
两分钟之后  看见你
in two minutes, see your little

623
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,810
在这做小场景  就会知道这一切都是扯淡
diorama here, and know it's all bull.

624
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,980
除了这一切都不会在这里
Except none of this will be here.

625
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,750
我也不会在这里
And neither will I.

626
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,460
你这个混蛋
Bastard!

627
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,930
啊
Aah!

628
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,510
这是发生在七年前的事情
This is for the last seven years.

629
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,120
不许动  把你的手举起来
Freeze! Get your hands up!

630
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,480
都举起来
Put 'em up!

631
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,350
是他  他就是科尼尔・奥提斯
It's him! It's Kaniel Outis!

632
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,290
感谢上帝你们能来
Thank God you're here.

633
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,990
感谢上帝
Thank God!

634
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,160
感谢上帝
Thank God.

635
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,800
感谢上帝
Thank God.

636
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,160
举起手
Hands up!

637
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,540
感谢上帝你们能及时赶来
Thank God you guys got here when you did,

638
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,010
我能说的就这些
that's all I can say.

639
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,780
我的意思是  他会
I mean, he would have...

640
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,650
我刚才差点就死了
I'd be dead right now.

641
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,220
听着  如果你们没有别的事的话  我想回家
Look, if it's okay with you guys, I'd like to go home,

642
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,820
整理一下自己  你可以想象得到
clean myself up a bit. As you can imagine,

643
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,420
这是漫长的一天
it's been a long day.

644
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,690
没问题
That's okay.

645
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,220
谢谢你
Thank you.

646
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,040
雅各・安东・内斯
Jacob Anton Ness?

647
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,360
我能帮你什么忙吗
Can I help you?

648
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,830
你因参与谋杀而被捕
You're under arrest for the participation in the murder

649
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,830
- 哈伦盖恩斯  - 如果你说的都是废话
- of Harlan Gaines. - If you're talking about that nonsense

650
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,940
- 在这里  - 我们现在讲的是关于血液的证据 
- in there... - We're talking about blood evidence

651
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,210
在你的办公室被发现了
found in your office

652
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,170
在大学里的  一个办公室
at the university. An office

653
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,740
只有你可以进出的
only you have access to.

654
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,380
找到了哈伦盖恩斯的血液
Harlan Gaines' blood.

655
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,740
血液最后将会被洒在
And blood will finally

656
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,710
被洒在它应该在的地方
be spilled in its rightful place.

657
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,250
什么  怎么  
What? How...

658
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,340
这些是从哈伦盖恩斯被杀当晚丢失的画面
These are the missing frames from the night of the killing.

659
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,010
被波塞冬剪掉了
The ones Poseidon edited out.

660
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,240
是的  那是我  我从来没有否认过
Yes, I was there. I've never denied it.

661
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,280
他强迫我
He forced me to...

662
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:07,150
所以他才能够陷害我
so he could frame me.

663
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,580
所以在你的衣物中发现了血迹
So the blood evidence found in your belongings

664
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,630
是因为他让你处理尸体时沾上的
was because he tasked you with disposing of the body.

665
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,060
对的
Correct.

666
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,690
并且随着额外的血液证据被披露
And with the revelation of the additional blood evidence

667
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,030
在他在大学的办公室里被发现
found in his office at the university,

668
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,330
这完全能支持你的理论  不是吗
it neatly supports your theory, doesn't it?

669
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,500
他在那里
That he was there.

670
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,270
他就是那个枪手
That he was the gunman.

671
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,170
我想我有一个问题要问你
I guess I would have one question for you.

672
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,480
我是中央情报局局长
I'm director of the CIA.

673
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,810
我能意识到这一点  这就是我给你发邮件的原因
I'm aware of that. That's why I sent you the e-mail

674
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,320
邮件里有直接的证据
with the evidence directly.

675
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,650
我的问题是
My question is...

676
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,550
你也会利用我吗
would you be manipulating me, too?

677
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,020
我该怎么做
How would I do that?

678
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,160
好吧
Well...

679
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,330
你看这个证据看得太仔细了
you look too closely at this evidence...

680
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,560
图片中的元数据  退化的血液证据
Metadata in the pictures, degraded blood evidence...

681
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,000
但你可能会发现一些问题
You might find some problems.

682
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,330
这取决于你要仔细观察的动机
Depends how motivated you are to look closely.

683
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,340
波塞冬杀了你的副局长
Poseidon killed your deputy director.

684
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:03,370
多年来  他一直是贵公司的一名癌症患者
He was a cancer inside your agency for years.

685
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,140
我给你们展示了他的真实面目
I've shown you his face!

686
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,910
现在  冷静下来
Now, calm down.

687
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,710
你应该知道我们有洛克先生的同谋
You should know that we have Mr. Ness' accomplice,

688
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,110
安德鲁・纳尔逊被拘留了
Andrew Nelson, in custody,

689
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,580
多亏了你的兄弟
thanks to your brother,

690
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,090
当我们看到你的电子邮件
Once we saw your e-mail,

691
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,750
我们正在审问他
we interrogated him.

692
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,560
他公开披露21无效的
He's fully disclosed 21-Void's

693
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:25,590
你策划谋杀哈伦・盖恩斯
conspiracy to frame you for the murder of Harlan Gaines

694
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,260
通过给你一个新的身份来隐藏你的真实身份
and bury your identity by giving you a new one:

695
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,230
科尼尔・奥提斯
Kaniel Outis.

696
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,530
这意味着什么呢
What does that mean?

697
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,300
意味着
It means...

698
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,140
你可以走了  斯科菲尔德先生
you're free to go, Mr. Scofield.

699
