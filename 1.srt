1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,820
-我没杀那个人 迈克尔  -证据显示是你杀的
- I didn't kill that man, Michael. - The evidence says you did.

2
00:00:04,493 --> 00:00:06,380
-有人陷害我  -你发誓
- I was set up. - Swear to me.

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,653
我发誓 迈克尔
I swear to you, Michael.

4
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:11,253
放下手中的武器
Put down your weapon!

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,486
我将判那你入狱服刑
I find it incumbent that

6
00:00:12,493 --> 00:00:14,773
斯科菲尔德先生
you see the inside of a prison cell, Mr. Scofield.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,673
我在找个人... 叫林肯·布鲁斯
I'm looking for someone... guy named Lincoln Burrows.

8
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:19,520
你为什么急着想见布鲁斯
Why you want to see Burrows so bad anyhow?

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,840
因为他是我哥哥
Cause he's my brother.

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,473
-我要把你救出去  -那不可能
- I'm getting you out of here. - That's impossible.

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,120
除非监狱是你设计的 但不是你设计的
Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

12
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,353
你是个让人迷惑的开锁高手
You one mixed-up cracker,

13
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:29,213
你知道吗
you know that?

14
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:30,320
成交吗
Are we in business?

15
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,833
现在... 只等时机了
Now... it's all about timing.

16
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:36,053
斯科菲尔德 你跟传闻中一样漂亮
Scofield. You just as pretty as advertised.

17
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,426
我们什么时候动手
When do we get started?

18
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:39,700
-我需要你的帮助  -你这是在叫我犯法
- I need your help. - You're asking me to break the law.

19
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:41,493
是我让你犯错误
I'm asking you to make a mistake.

20
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,740
别锁门
Forget to lock up.

21
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:45,140
快点
Come on.

22
00:00:48,653 --> 00:00:49,773
我们成功了 迈克
We did it, Mike.

23
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,180
不管最后结局怎样...
However this plays out...

24
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:55,533
我不后悔
I have no regrets.

25
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:56,813
迈克尔
Michael!

26
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:01,553
如果你看到这个的话 说明你安全了
Well, if you're watching this, that means you're safe.

27
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:03,166
我希望能在你身边
I wish I could be there with you,

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,853
但你知道 我没多少时间了
but as you know now, I wouldn't have had much time.

29
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:07,573
我已做出决定
I made my choice.

30
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:09,153
我不后悔
I don't regret it.

31
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:10,846
我们现在自由了
We're free now.

32
00:01:11,726 --> 00:01:12,846
我们自由了
We're free.

33
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,440
自由是要付出代价的
Freedom has a price.

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,006
7年前我死了
I died seven years ago.

35
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,140
留下我哥哥...
Left behind a brother...

36
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,646
妻子...
a wife...

37
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,466
和儿子
a son.

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,246
但是 死人也会说话
But the dead talk...

39
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:41,693
如果你仔细倾听
if you listen.

40
00:01:43,713 --> 00:01:45,240
他们就在你身边...
They're there with you...

41
00:01:46,993 --> 00:01:48,046
伸出手...
reaching out...

42
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:51,106
想告诉你些什么
trying to tell you something.

43
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:54,440
因为并不是所有的死亡都是一样的
Because not all deaths are the same.

44
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,633
有些是真的
Some are real.

45
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:00,293
有些只是故事
Some are a story.

46
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:03,186
问题是...
Question is...

47
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:05,673
你信不信这个故事
do you believe the story?

48
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,693
死了的那个人
Was the man who died

49
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,773
是你认为的那个人吗
who you thought he was?

50
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:14,713
死人也会说话
The dead talk...

51
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:16,560
如果仔细倾听...
if you listen.

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,760
还是很合身...
Still tight as...

53
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:30,433
像蛇蜕的皮一样
scales on a snake.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,340
巴格威尔 你上面肯定有朋友吧
Must have friends in high places, Bagwell.

55
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,620
我不知道像你这种垃圾怎么搞到出狱单的
How a cesspool like you gets his walking papers I'll never know.

56
00:02:38,246 --> 00:02:41,473
你口中的垃圾以前也是模范市民
This cesspool has been a model citizen.

57
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,666
模范 市民
Model citizen.

58
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,200
71.31块
$71.31.

59
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,666
笔记本电脑
Laptop.

60
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:53,733
一包口香糖 还剩3片
Pack of gum, three pieces.

61
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:55,553
那个你留着怎么样
How about you keep that?

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,406
你带什么进来 就带什么出去
Whatever you bring in, you bring out.

63
00:02:58,106 --> 00:03:00,386
还有最后一封信
And one last piece of correspondence.

64
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,413
我每周替你这种人收十几封信的时候
Something really wrong with the world when I'm receiving

65
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:07,660
就在想这个世界肯定出毛病了
dozens of letters a week for guys like you.

66
00:03:08,053 --> 00:03:10,380
跟电邮没法比
Nothing compared to the e-mails.

67
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:11,920
你们这种杀人犯
What is it with you killers

68
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:14,313
还知道怎么取悦女人吗
that put the satin on women's panties anyhow?

69
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,133
我靠
Lackaday!

70
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,473
布鲁斯
Burrows!

71
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,673
不如你出来
How about you step out and pay us

72
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:58,533
把欠我们的十万还上怎么样
the hundred grand you owe us?

73
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,826
就当你拒绝了
Take that as a no.

74
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:03,900
林肯·布鲁斯...
Lincoln Burrows...

75
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:05,966
拒绝了
says no.

76
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,013
硬汉啊...
Big tough guy...

77
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,120
名声在外
who made it out of the neighborhood.

78
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,273
看看你现在的样子... 又变成了老样子
And look at you now... back to your roots,

79
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:15,460
跟以前一个样
the way you've always been.

80
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:19,460
一个付不起欠债的三流小骗子
A small-time crook who can't pay his debts.

81
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:21,260
我们会找到你的
We're gonna find you, you know,

82
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,680
再把你活剥了
and we're gonna open you up.

83
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,600
林肯小宝贝
Lincolny-linc.

84
00:04:40,306 --> 00:04:42,720
好久不见
All huffin' and puffin'.

85
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:46,026
别像看垃圾一样看着我
Don't you look at me like I'm trash.

86
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,373
我家整整齐齐 我也身世清白了
My house is in order. I'm clear with the government,

87
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,346
监狱总局 天呐
the D.O.C. And my God.

88
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:52,160
跟你可不太一样
Doesn't appear to be the same with you.

89
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:53,946
看看你 完全堕落了
Look at you, all backslid.

90
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,620
你这几年应该发达了啊
You're supposed to be going up in the world as you age,

91
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,226
还是说 你没收到便条
or did you not get the memo?

92
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,420
你不从我的门廊滚下去 我就打爆你的头
You don't get off my deck, I'm gonna crack your skull.

93
00:05:01,453 --> 00:05:03,046
我不会走的
I wouldn't do that.

94
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,133
命运似乎注定了
Seems fate has deigned

95
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:07,280
要让我们再次联手
to join us at the hip once again,

96
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:10,626
尽管我们互相看不顺眼
despite our mutual contempt.

97
00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:17,020
看看这个
Have a look-see.

98
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:30,826
你从哪里拿到的
Where'd you get this?

99
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:33,180
这周早些时候释放时收到的
Received it on release earlier this week.

100
00:05:33,193 --> 00:05:34,766
没有回信地址
No return address.

101
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,146
要是你敢耍我 我就杀了你
If you're playing me, I'll kill you.

102
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,546
看看上面的邮戳
Take a look at that postmark on that.

103
00:05:42,546 --> 00:05:44,253
我可能很狡猾
I may be a sophisti-cat,

104
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,786
但是没达到
but not so sophisticated

105
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,800
能伪造这些的程度
as to forge something like that.

106
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,100
而且
Besides...

107
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,626
我有什么理由过来
what angle could I possibly have in coming here

108
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:56,660
跟你说你弟弟
and telling you that it looks like your brother

109
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,440
有可能还活着
might just be alive?

110
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,473
不可能
It's impossible.

111
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,706
我也是这么想的
That's what I thought.

112
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,153
他为什么寄给你
Why'd he send it to you?

113
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,880
我也在这么想
Again, what I thought.

114
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,260
然后我重新看了看这些
And then I gave the words another look-see.

115
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:50,253
可能这就是答案
Maybe that's the answer.

116
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:54,900
"借你之手"
"By your hand"

117
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:56,686
"你会看到子孙的荣光"
"You shall know the glories of your Progeny"

118
00:06:57,246 --> 00:06:59,440
"我们的世界将被
"And our world will be

119
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,466
永远纠正过来"
made right forevermore."

120
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,526
我要知道这是什么意思就见鬼了
Hell if I know what that means.

121
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:07,253
但就像信是写给我的一样
But just like that envelope's addressed to me,

122
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:09,246
这些话肯定也是写给我的 肯定是
those words are addressed to me. Got to be!

123
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,206
出去
Get out.

124
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:11,646
我在跟你合作呢
I'm trying to work with you here.

125
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:14,306
你弟弟有没有可能还活着
Is there any possible way your brother could've survived?

126
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:18,213
我弟弟死了
My brother's dead.

127
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,020
那这是谁寄的 为什么寄给我
Th-Then who sent this? And why?

128
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:23,680
滚
Get out.

129
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,153
起码让我拿走属于我的信
Least let me take my rightful correspondence.

130
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:35,886
算了 布鲁斯 反正我复印了
Oh, I made a copy, Burrows.

131
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:38,840
我就知道你还是那个婊子养的混蛋
I knew you'd be the same obstinate son of a beyotch

132
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,760
你一直都是 但我希望你有所改变
you always been, but I'd hoped you'd seen the light.

133
00:07:40,773 --> 00:07:42,873
但你就是你 一直都是这鸟样
But you are what you is and you is what you are.

134
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,393
不过 我还是要告诉你...
Still, I'm telling you...

135
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,673
无论如何命运还是要让我们联手
fate has got us joined at the hip somehow.

136
00:08:12,953 --> 00:08:13,910
哪里飞来的
Where you in from?

137
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,786
芝加哥
Chicago.

138
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,393
芝加哥是个好地方
Love Chicago.

139
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,740
-给你  -多谢 哥们
- There you go. - Thanks, man.

140
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,480
没想到我还能见到你
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again.

141
00:09:11,006 --> 00:09:12,466
你没来参加我的婚礼
You didn't come to the wedding.

142
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,320
我是说 我明白...我能理解
I mean, I figured I... I get it...

143
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,993
你不希望我嫁给除了你兄弟之外的任何人...
he hates me for marrying someone other than his brother, but...

144
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,466
我过的不太好 萨拉
I haven't been in a good place, Sara.

145
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:25,206
我的脑子里很乱
My brain, it's... it's been a mess.

146
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:26,973
所以我一直没露面
That's why I didn't show up.

147
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:30,413
而且...我不想我侄子看到我这个样子
And... I didn't want my nephew to see me like that.

148
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,666
但现在我没法撒手不管了
But now it's impossible to stay away.

149
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,893
有人开了个无聊的大玩笑
Someone's got a sick sense of humor.

150
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,580
我知道你希望这是真的
I know you want it to be true.

151
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:43,333
失去弟弟...
Losing a brother...

152
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:45,893
给你的人生留下巨大的创伤
the massive hole that leaves in your life.

153
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,606
和失去丈夫一样 巨大的创伤
Like the same massive hole losing a husband is.

154
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:51,600
可能吧
Maybe.

155
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,673
林肯·布鲁斯
Lincoln Burrows?

156
00:09:56,826 --> 00:09:57,560
雅各布
Jacob.

157
00:09:57,853 --> 00:09:58,953
我有几年没见你了
I haven't seen you in what,

158
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,266
-三四年了吧  -是
- three, four years? - Yeah.

159
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,253
林肯叔叔
Uncle Lincoln!

160
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,700
嘿 小家伙
Hey-hey! Buddy!

161
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:06,660
见到你真是太好了
So good to see you.

162
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,586
你给我带沉没的宝藏了吗
Did you bring me any sunken treasures?

163
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:11,340
沉没的宝藏
Sunken treasures?

164
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,040
潜水商店
The dive shop.

165
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:15,993
-巴拿马  -对 我常给他讲
- Panama. - Yeah, I've been telling him stories

166
00:10:15,993 --> 00:10:18,833
我们回国前在那边发生的故事
about being down there before we came back to the States.

167
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,133
你都快变成
You've become kind of like

168
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,773
他心里的传奇英雄了 我给你拿罐啤酒
a mythological hero to him. Let me get some beers.

169
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:24,970
-我们聊聊  -当然好  
- I want to know what you been up to. - Sure, man. Yeah. 

170
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:25,440
好的
Okay.

171
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,500
过来
Come here.

172
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:28,506
你先去冲个澡 好吗
I want you to go wash up, okay?

173
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,500
然后才能跟你叔叔一起玩
And then you can catch up with your uncle.

174
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,826
他不仅崇拜你
He hasn't just mythologized you.

175
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:38,740
他还崇拜迈克尔
He mythologizes Michael, too.

176
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,246
他觉得自己像是神的孩子
It's like someone thinking he was born to a god,

177
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,453
一位他从没见过
a god he's never met...

178
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,240
也不存在的神
and who isn't here.

179
00:10:48,353 --> 00:10:49,813
一位再也不可能出现的神
And who never will be again.

180
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,580
我该现实点
I can be pragmatic.

181
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:55,473
迈克尔病了
Michael was sick.

182
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,480
他病入膏肓
He was terminally sick,

183
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,486
然后去世了
and he died.

184
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:09,480
萨拉
Sara...

185
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,446
这你又怎么解释
how do you explain that?

186
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,306
这是处理过的照片 林肯
It's Photoshop, Linc,

187
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,533
或者别的什么
or something.

188
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,946
你得考虑到这是哪儿来的
You got to consider the source.

189
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:25,686
是T-Bag给的
This came from T-Bag.

190
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,266
我知道你希望这是真的
I know you want it to be true.

191
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,766
我也希望
I want it to be true.

192
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,353
今晚约个会吧 模范市民
How about a date tonight, model citizen?

193
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,673
长时间漂流之后
A little well-earned love

194
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,113
一点应得的抚慰
after a long time at sea.

195
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,860
桃乐茜小姐
Miss Dorothy.

196
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,726
从伊利诺斯州奥罗拉省
E-mailing her undying love

197
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:58,840
发来她永恒的爱
from Aurora, Illinois.

198
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:04,506
这个呢
How about this one?

199
00:12:04,513 --> 00:12:08,040
"来自尚佩恩坎农·阿朗佐的爱"
"Love Cannon Alonzo in Champaign."

200
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:10,993
光看名字就让人拒绝
Hop on that just on the name alone.

201
00:12:14,573 --> 00:12:15,413
什么玩意儿
What the hell?

202
00:12:15,426 --> 00:12:17,813
假肢研究中心
Prosthetic research?

203
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,080
你的萨拉很聪明
Smart girl, your Sara.

204
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,766
她说得对
She's right.

205
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:35,046
我只是太想见你了
I'm just desperate to see your face.

206
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,166
自从你离开后 我的生活就变得一团糟
My life's been a mess ever since you left.

207
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,480
又重操旧业
Fallen back into my old ways.

208
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,640
做一些你不认同的事情
Something you wouldn't tolerate.

209
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:47,273
可我有进步 迈克尔
But I got good in me, Michael.

210
00:12:48,946 --> 00:12:50,053
我变好了
I got good in me.

211
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,293
只是如果
It'd just be nice if

212
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:58,013
你能在这儿...帮我找到生活的方向
you were here to... help me find it.

213
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,786
所以..
So... yeah.

214
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:28,700
"奥杰吉厄岛"
"Ogygia."

215
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,346
告诉我你在哪儿
Telling me where you are.

216
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:44,320
看来只有这样才能查明真相了
There's only one way to find out.

217
00:14:11,946 --> 00:14:13,006
西奥多·巴格威尔
Theodore Bagwell.

218
00:14:14,526 --> 00:14:16,206
惠特科姆医生
And you're Dr. Whitcombe,

219
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:21,160
约我晚上九点半秘密见面
the man who invited me to this mystery meeting

220
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,766
这个时候这栋建筑的其他场所都关门了
at 9:30 at night when the rest of the building's closed.

221
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,120
我知道你的过去
I know what you've done.

222
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:30,733
所以我不想被人看见我和你来往
That's why I don't want to be seen associating with your sort.

223
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,793
我只想知道你叫我来做什么
Just want to know why I'm here, and...

224
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,193
是不是和我在监狱里收到的
if this has anything to do with that special envelope

225
00:14:35,193 --> 00:14:36,806
那封特殊信有关系
I received in the prison.

226
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,860
我不知道什么信
I know nothing about an envelope.

227
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,686
我只能向你介绍我的工作
I can only tell you my work.

228
00:14:42,053 --> 00:14:44,593
定向肌肉神经移植术
Targeted muscle reinnervation.

229
00:14:44,766 --> 00:14:47,126
能用大脑控制假肢
Using the brain to manipulate prosthesis

230
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:49,266
和长出来的四肢一样
as it were a natural limb.

231
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,246
但是 如此前沿的技术
But as with any cutting-edge work,

232
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,760
往往很难得到资金支持
funding is not easy to find, and yet,

233
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,780
难以置信 我能获得资助
incredibly, I got the grant

234
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,346
一笔巨额匿名资助
in the form of a considerable anonymous grant

235
00:14:58,366 --> 00:14:59,713
但有一个条件
on one condition...

236
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,040
第一个接受手术的人
the first recipient of my procedure...

237
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,593
必须是你
is you.

238
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,193
我能帮你装上
I can equip you

239
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,966
一副完整的 关节灵活的假肢
with a fully articulate prosthetic,

240
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:14,786
用起来和真的手没什么分别
operationally indistinguishable from a real hand.

241
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,346
所有这些只是因为一项匿名捐赠吗
All of this because of an anonymous donor?

242
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:21,560
看起来像是有人在操纵你我
Someone seems to have plans for both of us.

243
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:24,593
我给你预留了周一的手术室
I've reserved an operational lab for Monday

244
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:26,460
如果你决定了的话
if you decide you are interested.

245
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,813
反正是你的手
It's your hand, ultimately.

246
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:41,746
借你之手
By your hand,

247
00:15:42,586 --> 00:15:47,213
你会看到子孙的荣光
you shall know glories of your progeny.

248
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,266
什么
What's that?

249
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:53,980
没什么 医生
Nothing, Doc.

250
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,126
拜托 迈克尔
Come on, Michael.

251
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,053
你一定给我留了什么提示
You must've left me something.

252
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,853
拜托 迈克尔
Come on, Michael.

253
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:38,373
什么情况
What's going on?

254
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,940
我的天 发生了什么
Oh, my God, what happened?

255
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:39,726
我不清楚
I'm not sure.

256
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,846
我准备报警
I'm gonna call the police.

257
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,060
哈喽
Hello?

258
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:02,900
我挖开了迈克尔的墓 他没在里面
I dug up Michael's grave. He's not in it.

259
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,780
他...什么
He... What?

260
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:05,770
萨拉 刚刚有人想杀我
Sara, someone just tried to kill me.

261
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,153
他们一直都在盯我 伺机行动
They've been watching. They've been watching,

262
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:08,800
-可能是为了...  -谁要杀你
- probably for... - Who tried to kill you?

263
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:10,706
从机场开始的 我...
It started at the airport. I...

264
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:13,140
他们开一辆红色的轿车
There was a... a red sedan.

265
00:19:13,146 --> 00:19:14,306
一路跟着我
It started following me.

266
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,960
然后他们... 他们... 他们
Then they... they... they swapped

267
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,080
换成了一辆...
down to a...

268
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,220
-一辆什么  -一辆皮卡
- What was it? - A pickup.

269
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,200
什么颜色的皮卡
What color was the pickup?

270
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,310
黑色
Black.

271
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,380
怎么了
Why?

272
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,980
萨拉
Sara?

273
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,180
雅各布
Jacob?

274
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,420
怎么了
Yeah.

275
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,820
挂在砖墙的其中一幅画
Behind one of the pictures on the brick wall,

276
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,770
后面有个洞 里面
there's a hole, and there's

277
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,640
-有把枪 你把它拿出来  -什么
- a gun in it. I need you to get it. - What?!

278
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,940
就现在 快点 有人来找我们麻烦了
Right now! Right now! Someone's coming for us!

279
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,440
一把枪 你在说什么 一把枪
A gun? What do you mean, a gun?

280
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,070
迈克
Mike?!

281
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,750
911 你有什么紧急情况
9-1-1. What is your emergency?

282
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,870
有一个持枪入侵者闯入了我的屋子
I have an armed intruder in the house.

283
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,000
你需要你们马上派人来
I need you to send people right away.

284
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,900
没时间了 求你们 派人来
I don't have time. Please, come.

285
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,520
-迈克  -萨拉
- Mike? - Sara?

286
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,160
发生什么了 萨拉
What's going on, Sara?

287
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,200
-妈妈  -过来这边
- Mom? - Come here.

288
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,160
萨拉 萨拉怎么了
Sara? Sara!

289
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,360
屋子里只有我 没别人了
It's just me. There's no one else in the house.

290
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,970
-你想要什么  -进浴缸里去
- What do you want? - Get in the tub.

291
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,160
谁在那里 妈妈 他们想要什么
Who's here, Mom? What do they want?

292
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,320
我也不知道 宝贝
I don't know, baby.

293
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,060
好了 听我说 如果有人从这门进来
Okay, listen to me, if anyone comes

294
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,170
你不要动 好吗
through that door, you don't move, okay?

295
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,650
我会用这个捅他们 你不会受伤的
I will put this through them, and you will not be harmed.

296
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,220
明白了吗 好孩子
You understand? Good boy.

297
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,550
雅克布
Jacob?!

298
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,040
妈妈
Mom.

299
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,300
把所有你能找到的毛巾都拿过来
Go get every towel you can find.

300
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,460
快一点 就现在
Right now, right now.

301
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,940
撑住 雅克布
Please, Jacob.

302
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,680
我估计打到动脉了 保持清醒
Okay. I think it got an artery. Stay with me.

303
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,540
我要你看着我 好吗
I want you to look at me, all right?

304
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,970
别闭上眼睛 也别睡过去
Don't close your eyes and don't go to sleep,

305
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,010
我要你保持着清醒
all right? I'm gonna need you to stay with me.

306
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,450
来辆救护车
I need an ambulance!

307
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,840
他怎么样了
How is he?

308
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,050
子弹差不多射穿了他的股动脉
The shot almost completely severed his femoral artery,

309
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,830
医生在努力让他情况稳定下来
so they're trying to stabilize him.

310
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,060
那他呢
And him?

311
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,200
他才七岁
He's seven.

312
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,030
你还好吗 小迈
How you doing, Mikey?

313
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,170
有事情发生了 对吗
Something's happening, isn't it?

314
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,460
一开始 你出现了
First, you come

315
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,510
然后那个人就闯进了我们家
and that person came in our house.

316
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,300
这事情跟我的生父有关 对吗
It has something to do with my real father, doesn't it?

317
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,440
你为什么这么说
Why do you say that?

318
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,100
因为我可以从妈妈脸上看出来
Because I can see it in her face.

319
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,670
我得和你的叔叔谈一谈
I'm gonna need to talk to your uncle.

320
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,660
我就在那边
I'm gonna be right over there

321
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,980
你可以看到我的
where you can see me. Okay?

322
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,560
发生什么了
What's going on?

323
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,880
我们触发了一些事情
We've awoken something.

324
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,320
一些想被藏起来的 跟迈克有关的事
Something people are trying to hide about Michael.

325
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,770
你弟弟已经死了 林肯
Your brother's dead, Lincoln.

326
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,740
他真的死了吗 那他的尸体在哪
Or is he dead? Where is the body?

327
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,510
那他为什么离开
Then why did he leave?

328
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,100
如果他在外面那么多年
If he's been out there for all of these years,

329
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,140
为什么要抛下自己的儿子
why did he abandon his own son?

330
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,680
你知道我是对的
You know I'm right.

331
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,680
如果不是这样的话这些都不会发生
It wouldn't be like this if something wasn't happening.

332
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,690
-是不会 但是...  -让我们回击吧
- It wouldn't, but... - Let's fight back.

333
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,130
我都不知道我们在和谁拼命
I don't know who we're fighting.

334
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,390
我们去也门 把事情搞清楚
Let's go to Yemen and find out.

335
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,590
去也门 我有个儿子 林肯
To Yemen? I have a son, Lincoln.

336
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,110
我丈夫还在急诊室 现在丢下他们
My husband's in the ER. Right? Look, leaving them is exactly

337
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,850
才是我最不应该做的事情
the wrong thing for me to do right now.

338
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,910
女士 你们可以进去看他了
Ma'am. He's ready to see you.

339
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,210
等一下
One second.

340
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,710
我会去的
I'll do it.

341
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,210
我要去也门
I'll go to Yemen.

342
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,070
你特么一点都不了解也门
You don't know a damn thing about Yemen.

343
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,220
那我就去找个了解也门的人
I'll find someone who does.

344
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,360
再见了 小迈
See ya, Mikey.

345
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,150
我羡慕你
I envy you.

346
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,220
你完全改变了你的生活
You changed your life around.

347
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,380
我已经厌倦了不检点的生活了
A man gets tired of living a profligate life.

348
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,440
所以我参加了圣战 真正的圣战
So I took up jihad. Real jihad,

349
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,070
不是你在新闻上看到的那些疯狂举动
not that madness that you see on the news.

350
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,100
存在于内心的圣战
War within.

351
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,630
洗心革面的内心交战
The spiritual struggle to clean up your act.

352
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,580
追寻并且供奉真主
Finding and serving God.

353
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,340
挺不错的 哥们
That's good, man.

354
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,480
这世界需要这个 林肯
The world needs it, Linc.

355
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,980
我是说我们... 我们很渺小
I mean we're... we're small here

356
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,280
但我们做力所能及的
but we do what we can

357
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,580
去帮助中东的和平努力
to help the peace efforts in the Middle East.

358
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,220
在这里致力于反激进运动
Working on anti-radicalization campaigns here at home.

359
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,660
像我所说的 那种斗争
Like I said, the struggle.

360
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,460
这就是我在这儿的原因
That's why I'm here.

361
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,820
如果我要去也门
If I needed to get to Yemen,

362
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,660
有什么你可以帮我的吗
that something you could help me with?

363
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,540
我以为他已经死了
I thought he was dead.

364
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,430
大家都这么觉得
So did everyone.

365
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,100
但是 奥杰吉厄岛监狱
But Ogygia?

366
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,060
那是关重案犯
I mean, that's for heavy hitters,

367
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,320
以及政治犯的地方
political prisoners.

368
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,800
还在也门 情况不可能更糟了
In Yemen, it doesn't come any worse.

369
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,480
你知道要让人相信他还活着有多难吗
I mean, do you know what it would take to stage a death?

370
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,080
更不用说要把这个大活人
Not to mention keeping a man who is not dead

371
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,300
在眼皮底下藏七年
under the radar for seven years.

372
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,430
一定是一些非常有权有势的人
Some very powerful players.

373
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:18,070
萨义德 你了解这个清真寺吗
Sayed, what do you make of this mosque right here?

374
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,420
阿克萨清真寺 是萨那主要的几个清真寺之一
Aksa Mosque. It's one of the main ones in Sana'a.

375
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,620
非常醒目
It's very distinct.

376
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,890
看起来 从监狱可以
Sightlines seem pretty consistent

377
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,660
不受阻挡地看到清真寺
with what it would probably be from the prison to the mosque.

378
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,960
现在 我告诉你 这照片属实
Now, you ask me, that photo's legit.

379
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,400
那我弟弟就在这座建筑里面
Then that's the building my brother's in.

380
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,500
最简单的确认方法就是打给监狱问问
Easiest way to find out is to call the prison and ask.

381
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,420
迈克·斯科菲尔德
Mafi Michael Scofield.

382
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,820
谢谢
Shukran.

383
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,990
那里没有人叫迈克·斯科菲尔德
There's no Michael Scofield.

384
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,320
去网上找找他的照片
Punch up an image from the Internet.

385
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,630
迈克·斯科菲尔德
Michael Scofield.

386
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,080
把照片发给监狱
Send it to the prison.

387
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,800
可能他用了其他的名字
Maybe he's under a different name.

388
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,010
听着 林肯
Listen, Linc,

389
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,780
我得说一下
I got to say something, man.

390
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,020
你得冷静一下
Man, you got to slow your roll.

391
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,420
也门正处于内战之中
Yemen is in a civil war.

392
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,780
整个国家都快要土崩瓦解了
They're really close to collapse.

393
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,850
不可能任由一个拿着美国护照的白人
It's no place for a white man with an American passport,

394
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,240
在没有阿拉伯人命令的情况下 就这么出现在也门
no command of Arabic, to just show up on a whim.

395
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,410
但显然 我弟弟就这样干了
And yet, apparently, my brother did.

396
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,380
找到照片了 是你弟弟
Got a picture. Your brother's intake photo

397
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,140
福克斯河监狱的入狱照
from the Fox River Penitentiary.

398
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,660
这是他驾驶证照片
Here's his DMV photo

399
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,320
这还有一张 从他以前上班地方的网站找到的
and here's a photo from his old workplace Web site.

400
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,690
那不是他
It's not him.

401
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,730
都不是他
None of them are.

402
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,540
有人想把他的记录全部抹掉
Someone's erasing him from history.

403
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,350
-林肯 你要去哪  -酒店 去拿我的行李
- Lincoln, where are you going? - Hotel, to grab my stuff,

404
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,040
-然后去机场  -听着
- then the airport. - Listen.

405
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,380
你不会真要去也门吧
You're not going to Yemen.

406
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,220
-阻止我  -你熬不过三天的
- Stop me. - You won't make it three days.

407
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,250
我们得走正规渠道
We need to go through the proper channels.

408
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,820
正规渠道
The proper channels?

409
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,040
有人想要清除他的存在
Someone's erasing his existence.

410
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,800
是谁干的 谁有这个能力
Who does that? Who has that ability?

411
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,650
我跟你说 迈克尔准是
I'm telling you, Michael's caught

412
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,080
惹上大麻烦脱不开身了
in the middle of something big.

413
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,800
如果他没脱不开身呢
What if he's not caught in the middle?

414
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,430
你什么意思
What are you saying?

415
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,540
迈克尔从来没上过谁的当
Michael has never been anyone's sucker.

416
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,650
他一直都掌控局势 一直都是
He's always been in control. Always.

417
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,370
你的意思是他亲手策划了自己的假死吗
You saying he faked his own death?

418
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,800
我的意思是
I'm saying you need to look

419
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,240
在你身陷其中之前
at all of the possibilities

420
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,370
睁大眼睛看看所有的可能性
before you walk into a war zone.

421
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,130
我之前不确定你会不会来
I wasn't sure you'd come.

422
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,840
人有时要向命运屈服
Sometimes a man has to surrender to fate.

423
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,680
来看看还有什么在等着他
See what it has in store for him.

424

我们需要给你做麻醉

425
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,010
不不不 我不做全麻的 朋友
No, no, no. I don't do general anesthetic, compadre.

426
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,870
对于这种手术进程 全麻是强制性的
It's mandatory for a procedure like this.

427

你得原谅我

428
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,850
我无法就这么失去意识
if I have a problem lying unconscious

429
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,750
躺在你的装置上 看着你在我面前拿着利器
before a man with sharp items at his disposal.

430
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,420
这手术不全麻做不了
It cannot be done without a general anesthetic.

那你看看你现在什么样

别在我昏迷期间干任何不正当的事儿 不然我...
You do anything untoward to me while I'm under and I'll...

434

得罪谁我都不想得罪你
You are the last man I'd run afoul of.

435

Okay?

436
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,510
命运啊 你个故弄玄虚的婊子

苏克雷 你他妈在这干什么

446

你不准来

我只有一个单词 就这些
I got a single word. That's it.

就是... 我的资助人用一个单词代表他们
Just... my benefactors ID'd themselves by a single word.

560
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:46,940
奥提斯
Outis.

561
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,450
我查了这个单词
I looked it up.

562
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,930
它在希腊语中代表着"没有人"
It's Greek for "Nobody."

563
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,660
这就是你的资助人 巴格威尔先生
That's who your benefactor is, Mr. Bagwell.

564
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,060
没有人
Nobody.

565
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,080
好了
Okay.

566
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,060
这是谁
Who's this?

567
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:43,820
奥马尔在奥杰吉厄监狱有内线
Omar has connections in Ogygia Prison.

568
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,150
他可以安排一次探监
He says he can arrange a visit.

569
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,130
意思是迈克尔在那吗
That mean Michael's in there?

570
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,750
那里有个美国人的情况和你弟弟
There's apparently an American in there matching

571
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,100
非常吻合
your brother's description.

572
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,800
只是还有一件事情
There's just one thing.

573
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,720
安排这样的探视很难 非常难
Arranging such a visit is hard. Very difficult.

574
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,040
-需要付出代价  -钱不是问题
- Comes at a price. - Money's not a problem.

575
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,440
不要钱
Not money.

576
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,180
你的护照
Your passport.

577
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,710
我的护照
My passport?

578
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,760
什么...
What, did...

579
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,300
-你想压着它吗  -不 我就要它
- you want to hold it? - No. Straight trade.

580
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,080
你的护照换探监机会
Visit for your passport.

581
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,320
美国护照在这里像黄金一样值钱
U.S. Passport is like gold here.

582
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,270
只需要一点手脚 它就是通往自由的机票了
A few changes, and it can be a ticket to freedom.

583
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,690
别换 林肯
Don't do it, Linc.

584
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,560
我知道情况不理想 但是...
I know it is not ideal, but...

585
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,530
这是也门现在最实际的境况了
ideals as of right now are history in Yemen.

586
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,900
没有护照
You cannot get out of the country

587
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,610
你别想离开这个国家
without a passport.

588
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,880
别换
Don't do it.

589
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,680
阿拉保佑...
Inshallah...

590
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,610
你很快就能见到你弟弟
you will see your brother soon.

591
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,120
我告诫过自己 绝不再踏足任何一座监狱
I told myself I'd never step foot in another prison.

592
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,020
等我们离开这座监狱后再开始
As long as we walk out of it.

593
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,270
没有迈克尔·斯科菲尔德这个人
There's no Michael Scofield.

594
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,720
这是为了骗我护照吗
It was a scam to get my passport.

595
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,910
奥马尔是我最信任的一个眼线
Omar is one of my most trusted operators.

596
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,000
听着 女士 在这个国家
Listen, lady. Trust doesn't

597
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,620
信任似乎并没什么鸟用
seem to mean a whole lot in this country.

598
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,060
给我一点时间 好吗
Give me a second, okay?

599
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,000
我会想办法解决这事的
I'll figure out a way to work this thing out.

600
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,280
照片呢
An image.

601
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,730
他们寄给你的那张
Right? The one that they sent to you?

602
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,260
-哦 对  -你带了吗
- Oh, yeah, yeah. - Do you have it?

603
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,580
看
Look.

604
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,430
这个
There.

605
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,840
坎尼尔·奥提斯
Kaniel Outis.

606
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,470
对 坎尼尔·奥提斯 他在这吗
Yes, Kaniel Outis. Is he here?

607
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,960
他说 照片里的人在这里
He says, yes, the man in the picture is here

608
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,100
我们能见到他 不过只是因为是希巴带我们来的
and we can see him, but only 'cause we're dealing with Sheba.

609
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,560
你怎么知道那个名字的
Why did you say that name?

610
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,340
在我弟弟的夹克上
Because of my brother's jacket.

611
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,520
还以为你们是站在真主这边的
Thought you were on the right side of God on this.

612
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,730
希巴 别走 希巴...
Sheba. No, hey, hey. Sheba...

613
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,240
嘿
Hey.

614
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,620
坎尼尔·奥提斯可是个知名的恐怖分子
Kaniel Outis is a big-time terrorist.

615
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,060
他在这里被判了谋杀罪
They got him in here for murder.

616
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,480
他和伊斯兰国合作
He's been working with ISIL

617
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,100
试图推翻政府
trying to take down the government.

618
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,250
行了 C
Come on, C.

619
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,170
你知道迈克尔不可能干那些事
You know that's not Michael.

620
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,340
好吧 不管他是谁...
Well, whoever he is...

621
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,420
...我们马上就能见到他了
...we're about to meet him.

622
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,100
我爸爸是个怎样的人
What was my father like?

623
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,840
我真正的爸爸
My real father.

624
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,560
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德...
Michael Scofield...

625
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,080
...他就像一场风暴
...was like a storm.

626
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,010
相机准备好
Grab the camera.

627
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,780
我要证明他还活着
I want to prove he's alive.

628
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,840
他很迷人
He was beautiful

629
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:26,500
惊人
and frightening

630
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,690
神秘
and mysterious.

631
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,700
在湛蓝的天空中呼啸而来
And he would show up in your life

632
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,060
出现在你的生命中
out of the clear blue sky

633
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:39,200
但转眼就销声匿迹
and then he would disappear just as quickly.

634
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,600
但是 风暴会卷土重来的
But storms, they can come back.

635
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,800
对吧
Can't they?

636
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,240
问题是 回来的风暴
Question is, if they come back,

637
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,750
是原来的风暴
is it the same storm,

638
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,820
还是已经变了
or has something changed?

639
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,340
迈克尔
Michael.

640
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,190
新纹身
New tats.

641
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,840
新的是什么意思
What do you mean, new?

642
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,000
我们来救你出去
We're gonna get you out of here.

643
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,500
我的名字不是迈克尔
My name isn't Michael.

644
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,680
我也不认识你
And I don't know who you are.

645
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,060
抱歉
Sorry.

646
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,060
警卫 带我回牢房
Guard, take me back to the cell.

647
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,220
迈克尔
Michael.

648
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,660
迈克尔
Michael.

649
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,580
迈克尔 跟我说话 迈克尔...
Michael, talk to me. Michael...

650
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,520
迈克
Mike.

651
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:03,220
迈克 你在做什么 该死的
Mike! What are you doing, damn it?!

652
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
