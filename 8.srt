1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,400
- 前情提示  - 我们会带你离开这的
- Previously on Prison Break... - We're gonna get you out of here.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,880
- 逃跑开始了  - 走走走
- The escape is on. - Go, go, go!

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,390
这人谁啊
Who the hell is the guy?

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,980
他是我哥哥
He's my brother.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,960
你还不能死  迈克尔  你还没告诉我
Can't die on me now, Michael, you know, you're gonna tell me

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,080
- 为什么我是你的执鞭右手  - 我们找到了迈克尔
- why I'm your whip hand. - We found Michael.

7
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,810
- 他现在情况很糟  - 我得走了
- He's been busted up real bad. - I got to go.

8
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,350
你根本不知道去了会发生什么
You don't know what you'd be walking into.

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,410
太危险了
It's not safe.

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,270
我不能直视我儿子的眼睛
I can't look my son in the eye

11
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,160
告诉他我眼睁睁放任他爸爸死掉
and tell him that I let his father die,

12
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,230
他素未谋面的爸爸
a father he's never met.

13
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,330
从未想过我还能再见到你的脸
Never thought I'd see this face again.

14
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,280
你本来就不该见到
You weren't supposed to.

15
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,170
林肯・巴罗斯
Lincoln Burrows.

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,240
不如你站出来
How about you step out

17
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,970
把欠我们的十万美金还了
and pay us the 100 grand you owe us.

18
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,910
- 你内心很高尚  林肯  - 你应该好好休息
- There is nobility in you, Lincoln. - You should rest up.

19
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,380
- 我们会需要你的  - 没想到你还会担心我
- We're gonna need you. - Didn't know you worried.

20
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,710
这是应该的
About the right things.

21
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,350
怎么了
What's wrong?

22
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,250
他  你老公
It's him. Your husband.

23
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,450
雅各布
Jacob

24
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,820
就是波塞冬
is Poseidon.

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,220
他是CIA特务
He's a CIA operative,

26
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,490
深度卧底  他操纵了CIA的一个秘密分支
deep cover. He runs a splinter cell

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,390
叫21空室
called 21-Void.

28
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,730
他看中了我的技能
He targeted me for my skills.

29
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,130
迈克尔  我们儿子现在和他在一起呢
Michael, he's with our son right now.

30
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,790
我得尽快赶回美国
I'll get to the States as soon as I can.

31
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,500
是我的老公  雅各布・内斯
Did my husband, Jacob Ness,

32
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,970
请你查看我手机的吗
ask you to work on my cell phone?

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,800
他说他想要找出
He said he was looking to find

34
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,040
跟踪她老婆的人
the people who were stalking

35
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,310
所以我对手机进行了深度数据搜索
his wife, so I did a data dive.

36
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,970
我儿子呢
Where's my son?

37
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,140
在我这
I have him.

38
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,850
我是否对他构成威胁
And whether or not I have to threaten him

39
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,290
全取决于你是否放下枪
is entirely contingent upon you putting the gun down.

40
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,320
科尼尔・奥提斯
Kaniel Outis

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,390
目前定位在一艘
has been located on a cargo ship

42
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,860
行驶在地中海上的货轮上
in the Mediterranean.

43
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:27,960
是他们改变了你
They made you.

44
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,230
快跑
Run!

45
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,660
在这里
Hey!

46
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,650
救命
Hey!

47
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,430
哥们
Hey, yo,

48
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,260
我们在往哪开
where we headed?

49
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,560
马赛市
Marseille.

50
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,500
- 马赛市  - 马赛市
- Marseilles. - Marseilles.

51
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,280
你的命是我的  斯科菲尔德
I own you, Scofield.

52
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,440
我对你了如指掌
I know everything about you.

53
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,880
甚至包括你最平常的活动  比如逛动物园
Even your most mundane actions, like the zoo.

54
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,790
为什么你总去动物园
What's with you and the zoo?

55
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,090
我可以去那里思考
I go there to think.

56
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,390
上个月去了十八次
18 times in the past month?

57
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,590
我想了很多  我在想如何带你们
A lot of thinking. I was figuring out how to get

58
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,560
逃出巴兰基亚
your guy out of Barranquilla.

59
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,490
看来他并不只是个叛军领导
Turns out he's not just a rebel leader...

60
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,360
他还是个残忍的反社会者
He's a murderous sociopath.

61
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,080
没办法  我们现在需要他
That's the only way to make omelets.

62
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,060
我需要了解目标的更多信息
I need to know more about our targets.

63
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,100
如果让我帮他越狱  必须万无一失
If I'm facilitating escapes, we can't have surprises.

64
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,500
我们应该为此而自豪
Be proud. You and me,

65
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,470
- 我们在改变世界  - 那不代表这就是对的
- we're changing the world. - Doesn't make it right.

66
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,910
别装的好像你突然很满足现状一样
Don't act like you're suddenly a fan of the status quo, okay?

67
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,580
现在的法治系统  非常缓慢  笨拙  注定要玩完
The system, it's slow, stupid, and doomed to fail.

68
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,850
这就是为什么你一开始要救出你哥哥
That's why you had to bust your brother out in the first place.

69
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,790
又纹了新的纹身
New ink since the last time I saw you.

70
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,870
- 有新的计划了  - 不  没新计划
- Working on a new plan? - No. No new plan.

71
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,240
只是不想让那块皮空着
Just get tired of looking at empty skin.

72
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,900
你知道吗  我一开始就是被你在福克斯河监狱
You know, it was those tats at Fox River

73
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,800
纹的纹身吸引的
that caught my eye in the first place.

74
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,370
我对这个把计划纹在身上的男人
I had to know everything about the man

75
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,510
非常的好奇
who wore his plans on his skin.

76
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,250
显而易见却又十分神秘的纹身
In plain sight yet so mysterious.

77
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,120
真正的强者善于隐藏自己
The key to real power is to disappear.

78
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,720
- 内斯教授  - 你好  克罗地亚
- Hi, Professor Ness. - Hello, Claudia.

79
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,130
真正的强者
Yeah, the secret to real power

80
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,500
从不背叛自己的本意
is to never betray your intentions,

81
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,670
却又会隐藏自己的情绪
to wear nothing on your sleeve.

82
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,600
不让任何人
And to never let anyone

83
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,840
看到你的真面目
see your face.

84
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,490
进来吧
Come on in.

85
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,230
下次我被关进单间时
Next time I'm sitting in solitary,

86
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,370
我会想到这里的你  在舒服的空调房
I'll think of you in here, running the world

87
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,140
操控着世界
in air-conditioned comfort.

88
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,320
我也曾去打过仗
I've spent my time in the field.

89
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,580
你准备好去缅甸了吗
You all set for Myanmar?

90
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,040
就剩下几周了
It's only a few weeks off.

91
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,240
这就是我来这的原因
That's why I'm here.

92
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,010
我想再加一个帮手
I want to bring someone on board.

93
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,360
- 真的吗  - 实兑市的战俘营
- Oh, really? - The prison camp

94
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,720
是需要两个人才能完成的工作
at Sittwe is a two-man job.

95
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,020
我观察一个人很久了  他会派上用场的
I've been watching this guy. He'll be useful.

96
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,650
观察他  你现在负责
Watching him? You in charge

97
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,890
- 招人了  - 相信我
- of recruiting now? - Trust me.

98
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,290
我根本不想再拖一个人下水了
The last thing I was to do is suck someone else into this.

99
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,030
他可以帮助我  这样更有效率
He'll have my back and he'll speed things up,

100
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,060
增加逃脱的几率
increase our odds.

101
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,230
并未从事什么特别的职业
Not exactly a distinguished career.

102
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,810
他现在被好好的关在监狱里  他挺有脾气的
He's held up well in prison. He's got a mean streak.

103
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,820
而且他孑然一身
And he grew up without a family.

104
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,320
说明他可以被操控
It means he can be manipulated.

105
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,310
不管你在计划什么
If you're planning something,

106
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,110
我总能先你一步
I'll always be a step ahead of you.

107
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,420
你知道的
You know that.

108
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,480
我可以从你眼中看透一切
I can see everything in your eyes.

109
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,390
光看表面是不够的
It's what's behind the eyes that counts,

110
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,650
教授
Professor.

111
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,220
所以你打算用一年时间
So you're gonna wait a year

112
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,230
等我从实兑市逃出来
for me to find my way out of Sittwe?

113
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,890
还是你让我带上个同伴
Or are you gonna get me a partner,

114
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,010
这样我们能快点步入正轨  改变世界
so we get on with the business of changing the world?

115
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,860
成交
Done.

116
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,520
我想吃东东
I need some food.

117
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,990
我也是
I'm with you.

118
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,460
林肯  萨拉的短信
Linc, it's Sara.

119
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,160
她回到纽约了
She's back in New York.

120
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,430
她和小迈还好吗
Are she and Mike okay?

121
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,110
这正是我想问的
That's what I'm trying to find out.

122
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,690
怎么了  迈克尔
What is it, Michael?

123
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,820
出事了
Something's wrong.

124
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,640
是的  你们会的
Yes, you will.

125
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,680
- 我得尽快赶回美国  - 别着急
- I got to get back to the States. - Slow down.

126
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,170
你是科尼尔・奥提斯  记得吗
You're Kaniel Outis, remember?

127
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,910
你现在在世界所有禁飞名单上
You're on every no-fly list in the world.

128
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,910
雅各布对萨拉做了什么  也许迈克受了牵连 
Jacob's done something to Sara. Maybe Mike, too.

129
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,580
- 你怎么知道的  - 那封短信
- How do you know? - That text.

130
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,580
她叫咱儿子小迈克尔
She referred to our son as Junior.

131
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,350
我们都同意再也不那么叫他
We agreed we'd never call him that.

132
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,420
他在引诱你  迈克尔
He's baiting you, Michael.

133
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,750
那他奏效了
It worked.

134
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,930
嘿  小家伙
Hey, buddy.

135
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,370
妈妈哪去了
Where's Mom?

136
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,430
我在你上学的时候
Oh. I, uh, dropped her off at work

137
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,470
把她送去上班了
while you were at school.

138
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,140
这艘海盗船真不错
That is quite a pirate ship.

139
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,440
然而这么靠前的桅杆
Although it would be a little hard

140
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,440
船想航行可有点困难
to sail with the mast that far forward.

141
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,750
- 你的船可能会翻  - 这桅杆必须在那
- Your ship might tip over. - The mast has

142
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,610
这不仅是艘船
to be there. It's not just a ship...

143
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,750
也是个藏宝图
It's a treasure map.

144
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,980
这是什么意思
What do you mean?

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,390
这是给吉米的  我们把彼此的乐高积木藏起来了
It's for Jimmy. We hide Legos for each other.

146
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,060
我总能找到他藏得
I always find his.

147
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,120
他却不是总能找到我藏的
He doesn't always find mine.

148
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,190
等下
Wait a second,

149
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,830
这怎么是在画藏宝图
how is this drawing a map?

150
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,940
这是个公园
This is the park.

151
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,440
那是游乐场
That's the playground.

152
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,940
而这是人行道
And this is the sidewalk.

153
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,880
不错嘛
Impressive.

154
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,450
你把谜语藏到了这幅画里
You put a code in the drawing.

155
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,420
那好  你把乐高积木藏在哪儿了
So, okay, where did you hide the Legos?

156
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,120
这些大炮是公园里的泳池
These cannons are pools at the park.

157
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,850
但这里多出一个大炮  在沙子里
But there's an extra one, in the sand.

158
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,990
那就是我藏乐高积木的地方
That's where I buried the Legos.

159
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,300
干得漂亮  迈克
Well done, Mike.

160
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,350
干得漂亮
Well done.

161
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,470
我打听了所有人  我在美国已经没有线人了
I've tried everyone. I'm out of resources in the States.

162
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,740
我所有的联系人  那些可以去看看他们
All my contacts. People who can go and check on them,

163
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,140
确保他们没事的人
make sure they're okay.

164
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,740
林肯  我必须回趟家
Linc, I got to get home.

165
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,140
我不能再花两个礼拜待在货船上
I can't spend another two weeks on a cargo ship.

166
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,610
他手上有我老婆孩子
He's got my wife and kid.

167
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,180
也许有别的办法
There may be another way.

168
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,120
你跟我讲了你最近七年的生活
You told me about the last seven years of your life.

169
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,850
我还没跟你讲我的生活
Haven't told you about mine.

170
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,860
在萨拉被免罪之后  她离开了巴拿马
After Sara got exonerated, she left Panama.

171
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,890
我和索菲亚留在那里开了一家潜水用品店
Me and Sofia stayed behind and opened a dive shop.

172
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,960
我们分手后  一切都变糟了
We broke up, and everything went to hell.

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,430
你当时没在场阻止我  所以不知不觉中
You weren't there to stop me, so before I knew it,

174
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,440
我就在那片老邻里  打些零工
I was in the old hood, doing odd jobs.

175
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,800
打些零工是什么意思
Odd jobs meaning what?

176
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,470
帮卢卡・阿布鲁齐
Moving things from point A to point B.

177
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,080
运送东西
For Luca Abruzzi.

178
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,640
阿布老大的儿子
John Abruzzi's son.

179
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,210
是的
Yeah.

180
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,850
我只想赚点块钱  重整旗鼓
I just wanted some quick cash to kick-start my life.

181
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,520
他们跟我说不要看箱子里的东西
They told me not to look in the boxes.

182
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,520
但我还是看了
But I looked in the boxes.

183
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,330
他们从欧洲走私来的一大包芬太尼毒品
The amount of fentanyl they're smuggling out of Europe...

184
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,690
一盒有成千上万片药
Tens of thousands of pills in every box...

185
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,560
害人不浅
It's just killing people.

186
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,260
我把一个盒子扔进了垃圾箱
So I dumped a box in a Dumpster,

187
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,700
里面的药值十万美金
100 grand's worth.

188
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,830
现在你欠阿布老大的儿子钱
Now you're in hock to Abruzzi's son.

189
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,100
是啊  他想杀死我
Yeah. He wants to kill me.

190
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,710
但也许这是个能快点回到美国的办法
But maybe it's a way to get back to the States real fast.

191
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,850
你挺有胆量嘛  巴罗斯
You got balls, Burrows.

192
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,140
你真的觉得我愿意帮你吗
You actually think I want to help you?

193
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,850
如果我能给你十万美元呢
What if I can get you the $100K?

194
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,690
10万美元吗
$100K?

195
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,660
你打算怎么还
How are you gonna come up with that

196
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,620
你还在芝加哥的黑巷里摸爬滚打
crawling around the back alleys of Chicago?

197
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,460
我不在芝加哥  我在马赛
I'm not in Chicago. I'm in Marseilles.

198
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,860
- 你在马赛吗  - 是的
- Marseilles? - Yeah.

199
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,330
我最近在进行两笔交易  手头上有十万美金
I've been working on a couple deals. I got $100K

200
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,220
但我带着它逃跑了
in my hand. But I want off the hook.

201
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,970
你当然会这么要求  你过来亲自给我钱怎么样
Sure you do. How about you get over here and hand it to me?

202
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,670
这就是我打电话来的原因
That's why I'm calling.

203
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,370
我需要神不知鬼不觉的去美国  像你的药那样
I need to sneak into the States invisible, like your pills.

204
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,810
你那些从欧洲起飞的航班
Those flights you got coming out of Europe...

205
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,410
那些藏着芬太尼的航班  我需要几个座位
The fentanyl flights... I need a few seats.

206
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,920
行
I'll tell you what.

207
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,620
我会打几通电话
I'll make a few calls.

208
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,920
要么让我见你拿着钱
'Cause either I'm gonna see you

209
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,890
否则
and get that money, or I'm gonna see you,

210
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,090
后果自负
and you're gonna get something a whole lot worse.

211
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,160
我不敢相信自己又惹这样的麻烦了
I can't believe I'm doing this to myself again.

212
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,240
不同的是这一次  你不再孤身一人
Difference is this time, you're not alone.

213
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,250
天啊  这些东西真恶心
God, these things are disgusting.

214
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,810
他们管这东西叫什么来着
What they call 'em again?

215
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,180
法国血肠
Boudin noir.

216
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,250
不确定是什么做的
Not sure what's in them.

217
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,190
我不觉得你的法语像你想的那样好
I don't think your French is as good as you think it is.

218
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,700
嘿  开心点  你又不是在吃蜗牛
Yo, be happy you're not eating snails.

219
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,800
嘿
Hey.

220
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,500
你觉得他们察觉到了吗
Do you think they noticed?

221
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,110
咱还是别冒险
Let's not take any chances.

222
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,150
伙计们
Guys.

223
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,560
新闻上到处都是你们的脸
Your faces were on the news.

224
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,390
要是有人认出你们了  就完蛋了
Somebody sees you, this thing is over.

225
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,320
- 我们得走了  老大  -  我们得走了
- We got to move, papi. - We got to go.

226
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,990
等下  卢卡
Hold. Luca.

227
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,830
如果你午夜前能到里昂
If you can get to Lyon by midnight,

228
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,690
我能让你上飞机
I can get you on a flight.

229
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,020
我在纽约有个仓库  你会来找我吗
I got a warehouse in New York. You're coming to me?

230
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,060
我们会的
We'll be there.

231
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,670
我不知道我是不是
Can't decide whether I want you

232
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,600
真想要那钱了  巴罗斯
to have that money or not, Burrows.

233
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,570
杀了你会更让我满足
Killing you might be a lot more satisfying.

234
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,540
现在我们知道他们在地中海行动中活下来了
Now we know they survived the strike in the Mediterranean.

235
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,040
我们基本可以确定他会回伊萨卡
We can be pretty sure he's coming back to Ithaca.

236
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,520
我需要一些解释
I need some clarification.

237
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,050
他为什么会选择回来
Why would he come back here...

238
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,890
全世界
to the States

239
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,760
通缉他力度
when he's more wanted here

240
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,760
最强的美国
than anywhere else in the world?

241
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,230
当然了
Of course.

242
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,930
他这么选择是因为他们
Because of them.

243
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,480
他在为我工作之前有自己的生活
He had a life before he worked for me,

244
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,270
也有自己的名字  迈克尔・斯科菲尔德 
a name... Michael Scofield.

245
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,180
也有家室
A family.

246
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,070
当他逃跑之后  我就去找了他家人
And when he went away, I ended up looking after them.

247
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,980
最后  我爱上了他老婆
Ended up... falling for them.

248
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,850
现在嘛
Well...

249
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,720
他想杀了我
He wants to kill me.

250
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,670
他认为我窃取了他的生活  毁了他这个人
He thinks I stole his life, ruined him, which speaks

251
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,490
他是个反社会分子
to his dissociative mind.

252
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,240
我是说  他是个杀人犯  一个叛徒  一个恐怖分子
I mean, he's a murderer, a turncoat, a terrorist.

253
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,690
但我们要利用他这一点
But we'll use it.

254
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,730
如果必要的话我会去当诱饵
I'll be the bait if I have to.

255
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,330
然后我们就能一劳永逸的拿下他
So we can go about taking him down once and for all.

256
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,100
他不是来闲逛的
He's not just gonna stroll in here.

257
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,270
他太聪明了
He's too clever for that.

258
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,340
不过我们有个更聪明的人
That's why we got someone even more clever.

259
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,110
索罗
Thoreau?

260
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,780
那人一点前途没有
Guy's a pencil neck.

261
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,110
一个没前途但是熟悉斯科菲尔德的计划
A pencil neck with insight into Scofield's plan.

262
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,710
这样反过来  你占取主动权
So you, in turn, can be the hammer.

263
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,090
这是他从沙漠发的
Screen-grab of the Skype transmission

264
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,460
网络视频传输的截图
he sent from the desert.

265
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,920
他把图片通过服务器发送给
He routed the image through a server

266
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,190
这个蓝色夏威夷  但也有可能
to this BlueHawaii guy, but it could have been

267
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,890
同时发送给另一个人
secretly subrouted to another, yet

268
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,300
一个未知的接收者来使用这些加密的信息
unknown, recipient to use the information encoded in it.

269
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,700
信息
Information?

270
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,530
这简直难以置信
It's actually incredible.

271
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,170
通过阿拉伯语加密  这些图形五花八门
Encrypted in the Arabic, the images are all sorts of stuff.

272
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,240
显而易见的是  无聊至极
Apparently, mundane as hell.

273
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,980
动物园的营业时间  暂停运营的
Visiting hours for zoos, links to defunct message boards

274
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,040
一些网络公告牌
on the Internet.

275
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,580
什么公告牌
What message boards?

276
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,420
真实之烟网  猎手营地网
Truesnuff.com, Hunterspycamporn.com,

277
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,890
两个网站上都有  这个
both of which carry... this.

278
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,290
哈伦・盖恩斯谋杀案的图片
Images of the Harlan Gaines murder.

279
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,100
这个混蛋为什么把这个玩意儿又找出来了
What's the bastard doing rubbing that in our faces?

280
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,960
这么多需要解密的  为什么是这个
Of all the things to encrypt, why that?

281
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,530
这有什么帮助
What's that get you?

282
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,160
从图像数据加密角度来说  帮助很大
Stegaonographically, a lot.

283
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,840
图像数据加密是一种在数字文件的编码中
Steganography is the practice of concealing information

284
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,170
隐藏信息的技术
in the code that makes up digital files.

285
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,610
俄国在搞这个  中国也是  都在研究
Russians do it, Chinese, everybody.

286
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,440
他八成在想  要是有人看到这个
He's probably thinking if anyone sees this,

287
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,310
并不会仔细研究
this'll be as far as they'll look.

288
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,250
但是我已经进入图像内部  解密这些
But I'm already going inside the image, breaking down the data

289
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,680
- 组成这个的数据  - 一听这些我就头晕
- that comprises it. - This is making my head spin.

290
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,180
关键是要用大数据处理  人工智能
Point is we put big data, AI on this,

291
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,050
我们就可以把这里隐藏的信息尽快破解
we can crunch any codes hidden in there pretty quickly.

292
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,130
我也是正在加油
And that's what I'm doing.

293
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,520
干得不错  但是问题在于  如果我这头搞定了
Nice work, but the truth is if I've done my job,

294
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,360
他也许会主动把他的意图暴露出来
he may reveal his intentions to us first.

295
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,450
因为我已经把他的计划打乱了
Because I've got him so far off his game now,

296
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,520
他就会过早的进行他的下一个锦囊妙计
he'll start to play his cards too early...

297
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,820
泰迪
Teddy.

298
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,690
但是为了回报  你必须去杀一个人
"But in return, you must take a life."

299
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,380
也会在电脑破解之前
show us what the tattoos mean

300
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,970
告诉我们纹身的意思  还有
even before the computers will, and all the people

301
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,580
所有他准备为战斗招募的人
he'll be enlisting for the fight.

302
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,440
你必须去打这个
You have to call this pay phone

303
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,340
在法国的公用电话
in France.

304
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,550
等等  芝加哥  我以为我要跟你一起走
Wait. Chicago? I thought I was going with you.

305
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,250
你得先搞明白为什么你是我的执鞭之手
Not until you find out why you're my whip-hand.

306
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,090
我非得去芝加哥才能搞明白
I have to go to Chicago to find that out?

307
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,460
一路顺风
Safe travels.

308
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,560
他的计划太过宏伟
In the grandiosity of his plan,

309
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,390
以至于他会看漏最小的细节
he'll lose sight of the simplest details.

310
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,260
他给我发消息的手机
The phone he texted me with

311
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,170
昨晚在法国里昂
was located in Lyon, France last night.

312
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,200
在晚上十一点五十一分在机场关机
It was turned off in an airport terminal at 11:51 p.m...

313
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,450
在一趟直飞纽约的飞机起飞前二十分钟
20 minutes before a direct flight to New York where

314
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,810
在那里等着他
you'll be waiting for him

315
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,770
结束这场游戏
to put this game to bed for good.

316
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,490
290号航班飞往佛罗里达迈阿密
Flight 290 to Miami, Florida

317
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,590
即将从B24登机口起飞
will now depart from gate B24.

318
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,130
他又开机了
He just powered back up.

319
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,370
我们找到他了
We got him.

320
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,770
小心
Look out!

321
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,170
飞机后部
Back of the plane.

322
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,240
呃  不好意思  不好意思
Uh, excuse me! Excuse me.

323
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,910
你不能
You're not allowed...

324
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,790
看来游戏还得继续
Looks like the game's still going.

325
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,170
真是厉害  你可以通过
It's impressive how you get these drugs

326
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,940
贿赂一些机场临时工
in the country just by bribing small-time

327
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,270
就把这些毒品带入境
airport officials.

328
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,870
我猜这里有
I'm guessing you got about

329
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,510
价值五百万美金的芬太尼
five million bucks worth of fentanyl in here.

330
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,760
所以呢
So what?

331
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,800
你和你哥打算给我上课么
You and your brother here are gonna lecture me?

332
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,050
我们在考虑要不要
We were actually debating on whether

333
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,840
把这十万块给你
I should give you the 100K or not.

334
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,020
他说这钱来的太脏
He says it's blood money.

335
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,990
- 我也同意  - 你为什么不闭嘴付钱就行  巴罗斯
- I agree. - ?How about you just shut up and pay me, Burrows?

336
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,460
我没带
I don't have it.

337
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,680
抓住这几个  带到后面给我毙了
Grab his guys, bring 'em to the back and shoot 'em.

338
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,370
我不觉得你会想在自己的逮捕令上加上谋杀罪
I don't think you want to add murder to your arrest warrant.

339
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,170
等等
Wait.

340
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,470
逮捕令
Arrest warrant?

341
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,040
外面那家伙
That guy out there

342
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,790
是禁毒执法局的线人
is a DEA informant.

343
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,700
他是我们的人
We have him in our pocket.

344
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,880
他欠我们的  一个电话
He owes us. He's got three vans

345
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,410
他就能给你叫来三车特警
full of agents that are waiting for his call.

346
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,950
他们会把你和你的毒品射成筛子
They're gonna rain down on you and your pills.

347
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,120
除非  你免除我哥哥的债务
Unless you forgive my brother's debt.

348
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,420
我们的线人就不会打电话
Then our informant won't make the call.

349
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,390
让你弟弟给你出头  是不
Have your brother fighting your battles, do you?

350
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,690
不
No.

351
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,760
为什么不让你的小伙子们把枪放下
Why don't you tell your guys to drop the guns,

352
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,330
咱俩来解决解决问题
and you and I can have it out?

353
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,100
怎么说  卢卡
What do you say, Luca?

354
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,100
把那个家伙赶走
Scare that guy off.

355
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,200
把这几个人带到后面
Bring these guys to the back.

356
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,910
他们敢动一下  他就打电话
They make a move, he makes a call.

357
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,840
是么  我觉得你在唬人
Yeah? I think you're bluffing.

358
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,780
我警告过你
I warned you.

359
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,090
来人了
We got company.

360
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,890
敢开枪  这里有一堆的证人
You shoot us, there's dozens of witnesses now.

361
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,260
我们撤
Let's go.

362
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,920
他们只需要看见禁毒执法局的帽子和黑越野车
All they had to see were DEA hats and SUVs,

363
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,480
然后就跑了
and they were gone.

364
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,990
大名鼎鼎的迈克尔・斯科菲尔德
Famous Michael Scofield.

365
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,310
谢巴  感谢你做的一切
Sheba. Thank you for everything.

366
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,690
你绝对想不到我有多开心看到你回家
You have no idea how happy I am to see you back home.

367
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,630
我们还没到家呢
We're not home yet.

368
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,730
好了  下一步呢
All right, so what's next?

369
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,030
我们怎么抓住这个狗娘养的
How do we get this son of a bitch?

370
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,570
我们什么都不做
We don't do anything.

371
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,240
你的部分结束了
Your part is over.

372
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,010
不  不  不  不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no, no.

373
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,840
糊弄阿布老大的孩子是一回事
Tricking Abruzzi's kid is one thing.

374
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,780
波塞冬  他认识你
Poseidon... he knows your face.

375
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,780
自从到了也门就一直追踪你
Been tracking you since you went to Yemen.

376
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,350
你是个勇士
You've been a warrior,

377
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,050
我欠你的
and I owe you.

378
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,020
但是你的相貌会成为你和你家庭的累赘
But your face is a liability now to you and your family.

379
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,660
我不想让你陷入风险
I don't want you to risk that.

380
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,630
他们也许认识他  但是不认识我
They may know his face, but they don't know mine.

381
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,170
明枪易躲暗箭难防
It's the punch you don't see coming that knocks you out.

382
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,800
这才是我的谢巴
That's my Sheba.

383
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,840
照顾好她  行么
You take care of her, all right?

384
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,010
不应该是我照顾好他么
I take care of him, you mean.

385
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,050
- 我爱你  哥们  - 我也爱你
- I love you, brother. - Love you, too.

386
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,330
一路小心
Be safe,

387
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,850
- 好么  - 你也是
- okay? - You, too.

388
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,590
- 再见  - 好了
- Bye. - All right.

389
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,520
好了
Well...

390
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,290
如果再次需要我
when you need me again,

391
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,130
你知道到哪里找我
you know where to find me.

392
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,240
我们下午四点转移她
We'll transport her at 1600 hours.

393
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,870
在那之前  低调一点  谢谢
Lay low until then. Thank you.

394
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,890
嘿
Hey?

395
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,520
你不觉得难受么  刚才看到那些
That doesn't bother you... What you just saw in there?

396
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,690
地下室里是他的老婆
Down in the basement

397
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,860
他声称深爱的人
with his wife, the woman he says he fell for?

398
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,560
停
Stop.

399
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,070
在这结束后  我就退出21空室了
I'm done with 21-Void after this.

400
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,640
自从我们找到了斯科菲尔德  奥提斯
After we get Scofield... Outis...

401
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,810
不管他叫什么名
Whatever his name is...

402
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,810
我都退出
I'm done.

403
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,750
我的目的只是  找到杀盖恩斯的凶手  
That's all I ever wanted, to get Gaines' killer, but

404
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,710
但是他在里面所做的事
what he's got going in there...

405
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,120
十分不正常
That's not normal.

406
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,550
是私人的
It's personal.

407
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,380
有些恶心
Something sicker.

408
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,720
万  你知道的  不能离开21空室
There's no leaving 21-Void, Van. You know that.

409
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,730
他肯雇用我们  因为我们是最好的
He hired us because we are the best.

410
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,660
我们可以做任何他让我们做的事
We can do whatever we want.

411
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,200
如果我们之后想销声匿迹额
And if we want to disappear after this...

412
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,480
我们就可以销声匿迹
we can disappear.

413
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,710
但我们没法退出的
There's no getting out.

414
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,040
如果你这么想的话
If you think that way...

415
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,580
那么你也是个囚犯
then you're a prisoner, too.

416
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,100
门口的人说他们到这五分钟之后
The guy at the gate said the vehicles split

417
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,660
车就坏了
five minutes after they got here.

418
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,780
五分钟
Five minutes?

419
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,600
有些不对劲
Something ain't right.

420
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,140
东西还在那
The product is still here.

421
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,440
来
Come on.

422
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,180
一切都开始了
It was all staged.

423
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,010
聪明
Clever.

424
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,510
但是巴罗斯会因此而死
But Burrows is gonna die for it.

425
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,280
我不知道怎么找到他
I don't know how we're gonna find him.

426
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,480
他神龙见首不见尾
He's in the wind.

427
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,120
也许不是
Maybe not.

428
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,990
通关转发器
EZ Pass transponders.

429
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,190
圣托拉在边检处发现一个人
Santora's got a guy at transit authority.

430
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,130
我敢打赌他能告诉我们那帮人什么时候走了哪条路
I bet you he can tell us what roads they've been taking and when.

431
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,530
之后什么时候收拾他们就是我们说的算了
Then it's up to us to comb the neighborhoods,

432
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,260
把车找到
find the vehicles,

433
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,430
然后开枪把那个贱人还有他同伴们都弄死
and put a bullet in that son of a bitch once and for all.

434
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,550
_

435
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,360
请您时刻看管好随身物品
Please keep your baggage with you at all times.

436
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,030
无人看管的行李存在风险  可能导致
Unattended baggage is a security risk and may result...

437
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,500
我有个奇怪的请求
I got a weird request.

438
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,530
我给你几个坐标  你能带我找到他们吗
If I give you some coordinates, can you take me to 'em?

439
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,040
我试试
See what I can do.

440
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,280
不能
No.

441
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,940
除非这车能在水里开
Unless this cab's got pontoons,

442
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,680
不然没法找到
ain't gonna happen.

443
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,580
这些坐标位于密歇根湖中部
These coordinates are in the middle of Lake Michigan.

444
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,930
这里就是了
This is it.

445
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,260
没开灯
No lights.

446
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,370
迈克尔  我觉得他们不在
I don't think they're here, Michael.

447
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,710
除非他故意让我们这样觉得
Unless that's what he wants us to think.

448
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,340
走吧
Come on.

449
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,690
准备好以最快的速度带我们离开这里
Get ready to get us out of here as fast as you can.

450
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,350
林肯
Linc.

451
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,090
小心点
Be careful.

452
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,590
谢谢
Thanks.

453
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,780
怎么了
What's wrong?

454
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,110
这就是萨拉从不回复我的原因
That's why Sara never responded.

455
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,380
我不能联系任何人
I wasn't allowed to contact anyone,

456
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,230
但她是我的妻子
but she was my wife.

457
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,230
我用了一种我认为
I reached out to her in a way

458
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,800
只有她懂的方式联系她
I thought only she would know.

459
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,530
但是他也知道这种方法
But he knew my ways, too.

460
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,790
没人
Nothing.

461
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,300
我在伊萨卡

462
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,430
你在干什么
What are you doing?

463
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,230
那个人不是萨拉  迈克尔
That's not Sara, Michael.

464
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,790
他不知道我发现了
He doesn't know I know that.

465
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,750
谢天谢地  你和迈克能明天再走吗

466
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,810
好啊  我们去哪  还记得我欠你的那顿晚餐吗

467
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,440
去Filet Mignon餐厅好吗  雪城的牛排店吗  中午见

468
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,040
答对了
- _ - That's the right answer.

469
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,690
她还活着
She's alive.

470
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,960
他肯定和她在一起
He must be right there with her.

471
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,160
我会安排个会面
I'm gonna set a meeting.

472
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,360
然后呢  你要直接过去现身
And what, you're just gonna show up and show your face?

473
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,030
是的
Yes.

474
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,670
那也意味着波塞冬也得现身了
That means Poseidon has to show his face, too.

475
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,740
最后的游戏即将开始
And the endgame begins.

476
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,250
大中午了  老板
It's high noon, boss.

477
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,450
没看见他
I'm not seeing him.

478
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,320
不应该这样的  他正等着我们
And you shouldn't. He's waiting for us

479
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,590
先走出第一步
to push the first piece out onto the board.

480
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,960
所以由我负责第一步吗
Which would be me?

481
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,300
也许不是
Maybe not.

482
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,330
黑色的SUV车
Black SUV.

483
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,240
有什么需要帮忙的吗
Something I can help you with?

484
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:31,460
接送服务  我来这接一个女人和一个小孩
Car service. I'm here to pick up a lady and child.

485
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,180
他们坐别的车了  滚吧
They got another ride. Hit the road.

486
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,610
确定吗
Are you sure?

487
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,280
快滚
Hit the road.

488
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,450
追踪这辆黑色SUV
Mark the black SUV.

489
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,690
不用  他们只是想让你现身而已
No need. They were just here to make you show your face.

490
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,360
走开吧  马上  
Walk away, please. Now.

491
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,130
好吧  表现得谨小慎微一些
Okay, act the tiniest bit flustered.

492
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,800
现在给我用最大声重复我说的话  让别人都能听到
Now repeat these words back to me loud enough to be heard:

493
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,130
他们没出现
"They didn't show.

494
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,830
我现在回你那儿去
I'm coming back to you now."

495
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,670
他们没出现
They didn't show.

496
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,800
我现在回你那儿去
I'm coming back to you now.

497
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,140
现在我们有的玩儿了
Now we have a game.

498
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,080
他已经暴露了他最重要的部分
He's already revealed

499
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,010
他的哥哥
his brother, his biggest piece.

500
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,980
很快他就会现身了  跟着
Soon he'll have to show his face. Trailer,

501
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,190
把他拿下
please take him down.

502
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,040
什么
What the...?

503
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,750
我跟丢了
I lost him.

504
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,120
嘿
Hey.

505
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,890
能听到吗
Can you hear me?

506
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,030
该死
Damn it.

507
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,700
没信号
No signal.

508
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,170
你在这干什么
What are you doing here?

509
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,500
我在车库跟丢了目标
I lost reception in the garage.

510
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,150
见鬼  你正合他们心意
Damn it, you fell right into it.

511
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,680
他们现在可以反追踪我们了
Now they've got a mark on us.

512
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,120
黑色轿车
Black sedan.

513
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,920
他往西开了
He's heading west.

514
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,650
求你了
Please!

515
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,120
求你了  别开枪
Please, don't shoot.

516
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,490
你还好吗
You okay?

517
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,330
这就是毁了我国家的狗
So that's what the dog who's destroying my country

518
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,930
的下场
looks like.

519
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,770
跟我说说
Talk to me.

520
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,710
迈克尔  我们发现那辆车了
Michael, we found the car.

521
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,040
我们在第三大街和华盛顿大道交叉口旁的小巷
We're on the corner of Third and Washington by an alley.

522
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,480
马上来
Get here now.

523
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,880
萨拉在他手里
He had Sara with him

524
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,880
- 但我们没看到她  - 你说没看见她是什么意思
- but we couldn't see her. - What do you mean you couldn't see her?

525
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,610
我们没办法看到她
There's no way we could have.

526
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,280
哦  天啊  萨拉
Oh, my God. Sara.

527
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,160
后座
There was no one

528
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,790
- 没人吗  - 没  窗户
- in the backseat? - No, the windows

529
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,890
都被挡住了  我们看不到
were blacked out... We couldn't see.

530
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,530
那是什么
What's that?

531
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,630
我儿子做的
My son did this.

532
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,840
他很厉害
He's good.

533
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,370
这里一定有什么
There might be something here.

534
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,900
是个小船
It's a ship.

535
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,870
载着三个海盗的海盗船
A pirate ship with three pirates...

536
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,380
男人  女人  和一个小男孩
Man, woman and a boy.

537
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,110
这是我  萨拉和迈克
That's me, Sara and... Mike.

538
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,170
你觉得这个是什么呢
What do you think that is?

539
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,480
这是  这是一种多个头的九头虫
It's a... it's a many-headed hydra

540
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,320
正在抬首攻击
reaching up to attack.

541
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,940
这代表雅各布吗
Think it's Jacob?

542
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,580
肯定是
Must be.

543
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,390
- 这是一条信息  - 你觉得迈克画的
- This is a message. - You're telling me

544
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,460
这些东西是一种密码吗
Mikey's left something encoded in that?

545
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,930
是的  是的  这就是他的密码
Yeah. Yeah, it's encoded in him.

546
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,530
他有着我的血脉
He's got my DNA.

547
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,160
他甚至都不知道你要来啊
He didn't even know you were coming.

548
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,400
肯定是萨拉告诉他的  我不知道
Sara must have told him. I don't know.

549
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,530
她肯定告诉他我就要回来了
She must have told him I was coming.

550
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,540
这里绝对代表着什么信息  绝对有
There's definitely something here. Definitely.

551
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,950
那是谁
What is it?

552
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,040
那家伙是卢卡的人
It's one of Luca's guys.

553
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,020
什么
What?

554
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,090
他他妈的要在这儿攻击我们吗
How the hell did he track us here?

555
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,500
我不知道  我知道的只是
I don't know. All I know is all the chickens

556
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,740
总是会屋漏偏逢连夜雨
are coming home to roost at the worst possible time.

557
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,760
我们得走了
We got to go.

558
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,900
林肯
Linc?

559
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,640
我知道了
I got it.

560
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,910
这条船  这艘帆船
This ship, this galleon.

561
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,310
这个水的形状有意义  我在地图上找到了
The body of water it's on. I looked at the map.

562
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,200
这是一个湖  一个形状一样的湖
There's a lake, a lake shaped exactly like it,

563
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,750
就在手指湖区域
up in the Finger Lakes district.

564
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,190
长湖
"Long lake."

565
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,180
这个X
This X

566
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,720
代表了他们就在湖的东岸
would be on the east shore of that lake.

567
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,570
它在告诉我们它的位置
He's telling us where he is.

568
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,790
我还在想  你是不是已经失去了你的理智
I'm trying to figure out if you lost your mind or not.

569
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,260
- 你不去  - 什么
- Uh-uh. - What?

570
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,130
- 你要回到布法罗  - 什么
- You're going back to Buffalo. - What?!

571
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,490
我想要你和你的家人呆在一起  照顾那些难民
I want you to be with your family, look after the refugees.

572
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,900
林肯  我现在也是这个斗争的一部分了
Linc, I'm a part of this fight, too...

573
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,980
这是啥意思
What was that?

574
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,680
这是告别吻
It's good-bye.

575
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,020
如果你要是出什么事情
I could never forgive myself

576
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:52,290
我是不会原谅自己的
if something happened to you.

577
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,940
芝加哥  伊利诺伊州
密歇根湖畔

578
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,370
有什么可以效劳的吗
Can I help you?

579
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:12,910
是啊
Yeah.

580
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,310
我能租条船吗
Can I rent a boat?

581
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,950
我想租一条船在湖上逛逛
I want to take one out on the lake.

582
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,270
曾经想过
Been thinkin'.

583
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,910
上帝
God...

584
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,910
我一直在想
I been thinking.

585
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,980
因为我被赠与了一个艰难的交易
'Cause a hard bargain's been presented to me,

586
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,790
而我正在考虑一些
and I'm considering something

587
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,950
一些看起来像是
that's-that's gonna seem like

588
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,120
老西奥多・巴格威尔的事
the old Theodore Bagwell.

589
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,990
T-Bag
T-Bag.

590
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,270
如果这确实就要发生
And if that's indeed what's coming...

591
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,200
这将不是一个冷血的
it won't be the work

592
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,110
男人干的事情
of a cold-blooded man.

593
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,540
也不是为了罪恶
And it won't be for sin...

594
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,280
或者是仇恨
or for hate.

595
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,020
如果我的双手沾满鲜血
If there's blood on my hands,

596
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,120
记住这个  世界
know this, world...

597
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,030
这是为了爱
it'll be for love.

598
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,920
你怎么样啊  兄弟
How you doing, buddy?

599
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,220
我很厌恶这个湖边小屋
I'm sick of the lake house.

600
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,890
我想回家
I want to go home.

601
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:14,130
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

602
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,700
我们会回家的
We'll go home soon.

603
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,930
不用担心
Don't worry.

604
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,110
妈妈还好吗
Is Mom okay?

605
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,440
她
She's, uh...

606
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,940
这种天气  她有点
she's a little under the weather.

607
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,170
她只是在休息
She's just resting.

608
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,840
一切事情都会变好的  孩子
Everything will be fine, kiddo.

609
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,580
很快  一切都会恢复到正轨上  好吗
Everything will be back to normal soon enough, okay?

610
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,320
迈克尔  去找到他  我会准备好的
Michael, go get him. And I'll be ready.

611
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,570
- 谢了 哥们 很有趣  - 是啊  随时效劳
- Thanks, man, that was fun. - Yeah, anytime.

612
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,570
好的  很好  谢谢你
Yeah, great. Thank you.

613
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,710
鞭子算哪门子敬称
What kind of honorific is Whip?

614
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,680
你算哪棵葱
Who's asking?

615
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:52,350
一个被命运召唤的男人
A man drawn into this by destiny.

616
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,020
好吧  不如你把这件衣服脱下来
Okay. How about you take off?

617
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,250
我不会被一个大半夜来找我的男人
I don't exactly cotton to strange men coming up to me

618
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,920
给吓成棉花布袋
in the middle of the night, you know?

619
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,560
只有一个人能叫我鞭子  而你不是他
Only one person calls me Whip... you ain't him.

620
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,230
某人叫你鞭子
Nobody calls you that.

621
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,770
就是给我这智能义肢的人  某个人
Man who gave me this hand. Nobody.

622
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,560
科尼尔・奥提斯
Kaniel Outis.

623
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,240
或者对我们这些认识的人来说
Or for those of us who know him,

624
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,610
迈克尔・斯科菲尔德
Michael Scofield.

625
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,180
你是谁
Who are you?

626
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,950
我们都有别名  不是吗
We all got handles, don't we?

627
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,790
奥提斯  T-Bag  鞭子
Outis. T-Bag. Whip.

628
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,790
但你是戴维・马丁  不是吗
But you're Dave Martin, aren't you?

629
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,530
你怎么知道的
How'd you know that?

630
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,890
哈
Huh?

631
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,260
你最好赶紧告诉我  老头子
You better start talking, old man.

632
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,500
你不会想纠缠这个的
You don't want to tangle with this.

633
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,570
你也不用
Neither do you.

634
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,600
你想知道的都在这里  好吗
All your answers are right in here, all right?

635
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,340
西弗吉尼亚州下等酒馆
West Virginia honky-tonk,

636
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,310
1991年  漂亮的女服务员
1991, pretty waitress,

637
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,990
一堆个人业务在打烊之后发生了
bunch of personal business between us after closing,

638
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,750
然后我赶紧离开了  因为约翰尼・刘就这样插着我的脖子紧盯着我
and then I git, 'cause Johnny Law's breathing down my neck.

639
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,680
没有任何转寄地址
Lacking a forwarding address,

640
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,280
后来再也没听说过她
I never heard from her again.

641
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,820
你想告诉我什么
What are you trying to tell me?

642
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,330
斯科菲尔德当时在找一个合伙人  各个监狱里都找
Scofield was looking for a partner, combing prisons,

643
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,330
寻找一个可以帮助他的人
looking for someone who could handle himself.

644
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:20,500
随着你自己的天生的能力
And with your innate ability to thrive,

645
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,000
甚至可以在一个最糟的监狱里走上巅峰
rising to the top in even the worst of cages,

646
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,140
你让他想起了某个人
you reminded him of a certain someone.

647
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,580
所以他就做了点小调查
And so he did a little research.

648
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,610
想知道我们都想知道的什么
Wanted to know what we all want to know.

649
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:34,080
你是学来的吗
Did you learn it...

650
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,550
还是在你身上滋生的
or was it ingrained in you?

651
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,960
就是根生于你身上的  小子
It was ingrained in you, son.

652
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,430
你接了我的班
You got it from me.

653
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,350
林肯  他在这儿
Linc, he's here.

654
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,550
- 我的儿子  谢天谢地
- My son. - Thank God.

655
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,690
等会儿
Hold on.

656
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,730
等会儿
Hold up.

657
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,630
我想雅克布回来了
I think Jacob's coming back.

658
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,970
我真不敢相信又看到了自己儿子
I can't believe I'm seeing my son.

659
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,040
有点儿不对劲
Something's wrong.

660
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,070
萨拉在这儿  但是
Sara's here, but...

661
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,910
- 有点儿不对劲  - 不要声张  他回来了
- something's wrong. - Don't do anything. He's coming back.

662
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,850
我要进去了
I'm going in.

663
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,710
那不是雅克布
It's not Jacob.

664
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,910
危机解除了
You're clear.

665
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,900
接上家人  接上你的儿子
Get your family. Get your son.

666
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,340
巴罗斯

667
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,300
你好  迈克
Hi, Mike.

668
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,510
你知道我是谁吗
You know who I am?

669
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,580
我拿到了你的地图
I got your map.

670
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,550
我来接你和你的妈妈一起离开
I'm gonna get you and your mother out of here.

671
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,640
我  我没话地图啊
I... I didn't draw a map.

672
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,030
- 有人和你妈妈一起在这儿吗  - 那不是
- Is someone in there with your mom? - It's not...

673
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,470
我们得快跑了
We need to run.

674

雅各布可疑吗

678
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,000
不确定  但我们不能久留  太危险了

679
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,700
别担心  我马上就去找你了  我爱你

680
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,100
我也爱你  小迈克也是

685
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,700
好啊  我们去哪

686
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,400
还记得我欠你的那顿晚餐吗
