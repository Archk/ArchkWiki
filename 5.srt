1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,790
坎尼尔·奥提斯 他在和伊斯兰国合作
Kaniel Outis. He's been working with ISIL.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,190
你知道迈克尔不可能干那些事
You know that's not Michael.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,400
我们之后还需要你
We're gonna need you.

4
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,880
死了就能好好休息了
I can rest when I'm dead.

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,290
那也是我担心的
That's what I'm worried about.

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,100
我不会丢下迈克尔的
I'm not leaving Michael.

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,610
但我们不能为了一个人 拿这一切冒险
We can't risk all of it for just one man.

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,400
伊斯兰国攻破了检查站
ISIL has broken through the checkpoint.

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,880
萨那城已经沦陷了
Sana'a is falling.

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,900
不合作 咱们都得死
We work together or we both die.

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,580
我保证
You have my word.

12
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,080
阿布·拉马尔才是波塞冬想放出来的那个人
It's Abu Ramal that Poseidon wants free.

13
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,780
波塞冬派你来的吗
Poseidon sent you?

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,900
住手
Enough!

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,200
他到底是谁
Who the hell is this guy?

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,780
-我哥哥  -你怎么又进监狱了...
- He's my brother. - Back at the prison...

17
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,570
我必须否认... 你在 你在拍我
I had to deny... you were, you were filming me.

18
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,770
他们不能知道
and they can't know.

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,370
阿布·拉马尔已经被杀了
Abu Ramal has been martyred.

20
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,110
整个伊斯兰国军队
The entire army of ISIL

21
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,310
向我们宣战了
just declared war on us.

22
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,180
看看这大反派
Behold the villain.

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,600
我进城买点咖啡
Hey. I, uh, I ran into town to get some coffee.

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,490
-你要什么吗  -不 不需要
- Do you want anything? - No. I'm good.

25
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,080
谢谢你亲爱的 我这边马上结束了
Thanks, honey. I'm almost done here.

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,210
我马上就到湖那边找你 好吗
I will see you at the lake in a little while, okay?

27
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,100
好 回家见
Okay. I'll see you back at the house.

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,380
你丈夫吗
The hubby?

29
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,600
你从凯勒曼那边发现什么了
Uh, what did you learn from Kellerman?

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,710
真是难以启齿 亲爱的
There's no easy way to deliver this news, darling.

31
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,200
你会心碎的
It's a heartbreaker.

32
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,600
并不是什么好消息
Doesn't get any better.

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,000
他坏到骨子里了
He's rotten all the way to the core.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,820
你一直跟敌人同床共枕
You've been sleeping with the enemy, baby.

35
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,800
我不明白
I don't understand.

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,290
这两个鬼杀了凯勒曼之后
I followed them two monkeys from Kellerman's house

37
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,400
我从凯勒曼家里一直跟踪他们
right after they put a bullet in him.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,610
不用说他不是我们要找的人
Needless to say he wasn't our guy.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,680
不过他的确警告了我们
He did say some pretty alarming things

40
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,510
关于你儿子 波塞冬 世界混乱制造者
about your boy, Poseidon, the world shaker.

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,400
信息不够 我难以理清头绪
Didn't give me enough to put all the pieces together.

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,700
等等 倒回去 他们说了什么
Back up, back up, back up. What did they say?

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,680
雅各布 他说了什么
Jacob? His words?

44
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,200
我接近不了 没听到多少 但我的确...
I couldn't get close enough to hear much, but what I did...

45
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,890
听到了你和迈克尔的名字
what I did hear was your name and Michael's.

46
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,400
对 他们看上起很惬意
Yes, they seemed pretty cozy,

47
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,260
-他们三个  -我的天呐
- the three of them. - Oh, my God.

48
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,680
肯定是在暗中密谋... 你去哪儿
It's a nasty bag of conspire... Where are you going?!

49
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,910
去找我儿子
To my son!

50
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,900
蹲下来 蹲下来
Stay down. Stay down.

51
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,400
又是一次炮火攻击
It's another artillery strike.

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,200
他们肯定都习惯了
But they sure as hell are used to it.

53
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,410
跑 跑
Go, go!

54
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,720
真主伟大 真主伟大
Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar.

55
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,510
真主伟大
Allahu Akbar.

56
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,510
伊斯兰国刚刚悬赏了一千万要我们的人头
ISIL just offered ten million for our heads!

57
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,910
等等 等等 待在这儿
Wait. Wait. Stay here.

58
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,800
我们不能呆在这儿 不然就死定了
We got to get off these streets or we're dead.

59
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,490
一千万伊朗币
Ten million rial?

60
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,200
这么多钱 卖了你妈都愿意
You give up your mother for cash like that.

61
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,320
弗雷迪·墨库里的骨灰差不多这个价
It's about what I paid for Freddie Mercury's ashes.

62
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,000
现在说有意思吗
Freddie Mercury now, really?

63
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,610
总比讨论50万人
It's better than talking about 500,000 people

64
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,700
追杀我们好
looking to kill us.

65
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,120
快点
Come on.

66
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,800
找个地方躲起来想想下一步怎么办
Found a place to figure out next steps.

67
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,600
我们走
Let's go.

68
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,480
现在你告诉我到底发生了什么
This is the part you tell me what's going on,

69
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,700
整件事情
the whole thing.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,300
不 没 没时间
No. Th-There's no time.

71
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,380
这国家要完了
Country's about to fall.

72
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,790
我保证之后会告诉你的
You'll get your answers, I promise.

73
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,480
现在我们别无出路
Right now our window is closing.

74
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,190
我们得...
We need to...

75
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,370
得转移到下一个应急点
We need to pivot to the next contingency.

76
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,280
-去火车站  -到北边去
- Train station. - Get up to the north.

77
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,410
从北离开这个国家
Exit the country that way.

78
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,600
你在奥杰吉厄岛监狱这四年
Things have changed in the four years

79
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,510
事情已经变了 迈克尔
you've been locked up in Ogygia, Michael.

80
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,800
你的计划没用了
Your plan's redundant.

81
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,800
伊斯兰国控制了北方 公路 检查点 火车站全部控制了
ISIL control the north, roads, checkpoints, train stations.

82
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,680
即使能穿过城 出去等于自杀
Even if we make it across the city, it's suicide.

83
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,880
不 你错了 这是金蝉脱壳
No. You're wrong. It's a shell game.

84
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,290
最危险的地方就是最安全的地方
You go where they never expect you.

85
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,890
等等 你大老远跑来也门找他
Wait. You came all the way to Yemen looking for him.

86
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,180
你以为他失踪了还是怎么了
You think he was lost or something?

87
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,080
说说
Come on.

88
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,600
你想活下去吗
You want to live?

89
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,100
机场是唯一的选择
The airport's the only option.

90
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,280
机场是通往外面世界的主要通道
The airport's known as the main artery to the outside world.

91
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,090
伊斯兰国肯定最先关掉机场
It's the first thing ISIL will shut down.

92
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,270
飞机一小时前飞走了 你有电话吗
Planes were flying an hour ago. You got a phone?

93
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,300
没有 但他有
No, but he does.

94
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,500
虽然是对着手机自慰
Burned it up jacking off to Queen, though.

95
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,980
我承认了
Guilty as charged.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,420
我们说好了 C-Note在飞机上找到一条通道
C-Note's organizing a passage on the flight as we speak.

97
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,680
不 我告诉你
No, I'm telling you,

98
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,890
我的计划会成功的
my plan will work.

99
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,900
一旦... 一旦离开
Once... once you leave

100
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,900
萨那北部...
the northern part of Sana'a...

101
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,790
够了 我们根本不该讨论这些
Enough. We shouldn't even be talking about this.

102
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,190
放开我
Get off me!

103
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,400
你为什么还活着
How are you alive?!

104
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,600
跑到也门来了
In Yemen?!

105
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,290
究竟发生了什么 迈克尔
What happened to you, Michael?!

106
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,210
你要是不跟我说清楚我一步都不走了
Now, I'm not moving another inch until you tell me

107
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,990
这里到底发生了什么
what the hell is really going on here.

108
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,000
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德必须死
Michael Scofield had to die.

109
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,100
我必须假装自己死了
I had to fake my death.

110
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,180
然后离开
Go away.

111
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,400
这是交易的一部分
It was part of the deal I made.

112
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,640
如果我为卧底特工工作
If I went to work for a deep-cover operative

113
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,840
波塞冬...
named Poseidon...

114
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,400
我们都会自由
we would all go free.

115
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,180
我们已经自由了
We were free.

116
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,580
我们已经被赦免了
We were exonerated.

117
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,720
不 那只是我们以为的...
No. That's what we thought...

118
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,600
但我们错了
but we were wrong.

119
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,090
我跟萨拉结婚前几周
A few weeks before I married Sara...

120
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,010
波塞冬找到了我
I was approached by Poseidon.

121
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,680
你觉得我在炫耀吗
You think I'm showing?

122
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,220
我还没习惯
I'm not used to that yet.

123
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,710
我得... 我得告诉迈克尔
I got to... I got to tell Michael.

124
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,090
给你
Here you go. Burgers will

125
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,580
-汉堡马上就到  -你好
- be just a second. - Hello?

126
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,400
对 我是迈克尔
Yes, this is Michael.

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,880
波塞冬告诉我凯勒曼没有权利
Poseidon told me Kellerman didn't have

128
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,780
赦免我们的罪行
the authority or jurisdiction to exonerate our crimes.

129
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,700
他拿这件事当成筹码
He used that as a legal fulcrum.

130
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,680
跟我说他能把我们所有人
Told me he could put us all away for life

131
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,510
绳之于法 除非...
within the mandate of the law unless...

132
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,880
除非我为他工作
unless I went to work for him.

133
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,100
他们他妈的怎么能
What the hell can they be talking about

134
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,490
在这种时候聊天
at a time like this?

135
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,300
我不知道...
I don't know...

136
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,190
不过哥俩到底在说啥 我也想知道
but big brother's hearing things I want to hear.

137
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,300
我们不能留在这儿
We cannot stay.

138
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,900
得马上离开
We must go now.

139
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,290
也许不用
Maybe we don't.

140
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
你他妈说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

141
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,410
也许所有的逃跑
Maybe all this running

142
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,200
不过是延长死期
is just delaying the inevitable.

143
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:33,200
不是独自死在这儿 就是在家孤独终老
Die alone here. Die alone at home.

144
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,490
你该找个女朋友
God, you need a girlfriend, man.

145
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,600
有声音靠近 他们快找到我们了
Those voices are heading our way. They're almost on us.

146
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,990
这波塞冬是谁啊
Who the hell is this Poseidon guy?

147
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,590
一个神经病
A psychopath.

148
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,400
一个失望的中央情报局政策研究人员
A frustrated policy wonk in the CIA

149
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,080
他觉得自己比上级更强
who felt he could do better than his superiors.

150
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,490
他在中情局造了个细胞叫空洞二一
So, he created a cell within the CIA called 21-Void,

151
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,700
来实行他自己的智能手术
implementing his own intelligence operations.

152
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,300
他找我帮忙
And he needed my help

153
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,000
把囚禁在世界各个角落的人带出来
breaking out people imprisoned all over the world.

154
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,180
恐怖分子
Terrorists,

155
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,000
反党者
political dissidents...

156
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,900
流氓劫匪...
rogue agents...

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,290
如果我照做 你和萨拉 你们都能自由
and if I did it, you and Sara, you'd go free.

158
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,600
你的前科记录可以删除
Your record's expunged,

159
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,500
但是... 我们有过争执
but... there was a rub.

160
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,920
他不允许我联系你们
I wasn't allowed to have contact with any of you,

161
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,810
儿子也不行
including my son.

162
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,710
迈克尔
Michael.

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,290
所以 迈克尔·斯科菲尔德死了...
So, Michael Scofield was dead and...

164
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,780
我用不同的假名字过了很多年
over the years I assumed many names.

165
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,680
坎尼尔·奥提斯 最新的一个
Kaniel Outis... the most recent.

166
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,480
为什么你不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

167
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,590
为什么不联系我
Why didn't you reach out to me?

168
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,300
我无从选择
I didn't have a choice.

169
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,700
波塞冬做得很... 决绝
Poseidon made that... very clear.

170
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,700
怎么说
How?

171
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,480
一开始 我拒绝了
At first, I said no.

172
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,690
我不想帮他
I wouldn't do it.

173
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,420
没几周 萨拉就被监禁 挨打
Then within weeks, Sara was incarcerated, beaten.

174
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,200
我就答应了
And so I gave in.

175
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,900
我做的一切 都是为了家人
Everything I did, I did for family,

176
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,800
为了你 为了萨拉
for you, for Sara,

177
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,900
为了迈克... 为了让你们远离监狱的生活
for Mike... so none of you would ever have to spend another day

178
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,000
不用过着逃亡的日子
inside a prison cell or... or live a life on the run.

179
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,610
看看我们现在
Look at us now.

180
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,490
他们开始搜查房屋了
They're starting to search the buildings.

181
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,480
-去火车站  -机场
- Train station. - Airport.

182
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,800
火车站
Train station.

183
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,310
所有旅客必须出示机票
All passengers must present a ticket.

184
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,590
所有旅客必须出示机票
All passengers must present a ticket.

185
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,690
这样可上不了飞机 我们得穿过去
Never gonna get to our seats. We need to go through there.

186
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,480
机长都坐不上飞机
Even the pilot can't get on the plane.

187
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,890
这个飞机场停满了飞机
This is an airport full of planes.

188
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,680
-总会有别的机长 -情况不妙
- There's got to be others. - It's no good.

189
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,370
今天大家会死在这里
People will die here today.

190
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,900
再想个办法
We need another option.

191
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,590
-找我的人 奥马尔  -奥马尔
- My man, Omar. - Omar?

192
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,710
那个狡猾的家伙
That slippery brother?

193
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,370
信任是奢侈品
Trust is a luxury right now.

194
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,400
在这点上 他值得信任
He can be trusted. To a point. He has connections on

195
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,210
-他能联系桑西部海岸 带我们穿过沙漠  -不行
- the western coast, across the desert. - No.

196
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,980
林肯和迈克尔还在路上 这才是计划
Lincoln and Michael are coming here. That's the plan.

197
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,790
如果我们离开 他们就无处可逃了
They don't have a next move if we leave.

198
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,590
现在他们还在外面 天知道在哪里
Now they're out there somewhere, God knows where.

199
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,780
你的朋友们来得太迟了 看看你周围
Your friends are too late. Look around you.

200
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,580
这机场对他们没好处
This airport is no good to them.

201
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,280
我们不走
We're not leaving.

202
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,880
你们要去哪儿
What is that place?

203
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,680
西方人逃出来
Where the westerners went

204
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,100
去哪里了
when they made their escape.

205
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,390
我去过一个窝点
I ran into one at the Forger's Den.

206
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,680
我能帮上忙
I can help.

207
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,280
你个独眼龙
And how do you expect to find the foreigners

208
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,780
怎么找外国人
with only one eye?

209
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
他们来了 伊斯兰国的来了
They're here. ISIL are here!

210
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,920
过来 跟我来 我有主意
Come on, come on. I have an idea.

211
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,190
机长
The pilot.

212
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,070
跟我来 跟我来
Okay, follow me. Follow me!

213
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,280
别跟丢 别跟丢了机长
Don't lose him. Don't lose the pilot.

214
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,280
快点 快点 快点
Come on. Come on, come on.

215
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,090
快快 快点跑
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

216
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,210
别太高 猫下身体
No, just stay down.

217
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,000
好 在这等我
Okay. Wait here.

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,980
-什么  -马上回来
- What? - I'll be back.

219
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,980
-本杰明...  -别跟来
- Benjamin... - I'm going alone.

220
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,200
别去
Don't do it.

221
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
站住
Halt!

222
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,480
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

223
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,290
-跪下  -别动
- On your knees! - Halt!

224
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,600
出来 出来
Come out. Come out.

225
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,080
你是谁 证件呢
Who are you? Papers.

226
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,000
-别开枪 别开枪  -证件
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot. - Papers.

227
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,100
异教徒
Infidels!

228
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,600
异教徒在机场里
The infidels are in the airport.

229
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,290
杀了拉马尔的凶手 我亲眼看到了
The killers of Ramal! I've seen them with my own eyes.

230
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,820
-什么  -我要报酬
- What? - I want my reward.

231
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,300
一千万里亚尔 我要有钱了
The ten million rial. I will be rich.

232
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,590
-带我们去  -除非你保证
-Take us to them. - Not until you promise

233
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,280
我能拿到一千万里亚尔
I will get my ten million rial.

234
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,980
如果是真的 你会拿到这笔钱
If you speak the truth, you'll have the money.

235
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,790
你打了很多无辜的穆斯林
You kick a lot of ass for a good Muslim.

236
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,570
人是活的 路是死的
You can take the man out of the streets,

237
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,480
既然没有别的路 只能杀了拦路人
but you can't take the streets of the man.

238
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,390
你为什么帮我 你是谁
Why do you help me? Who are you?

239
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,680
我和你一样
I'm a man, just like you,

240
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,610
想逃开这个鬼地方
trying to get out of this madness,

241
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,480
可我们没法从那些门出去
but we're not gonna get out through those gates.

242
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,590
现在出去的唯一方法
The only way out now

243
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,910
是飞机 哥们儿
is up, brother.

244
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,630
波音747没法用
The 747 is done.

245
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,880
已经被叛军包围了
It's been secured by the rebels.

246
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,000
我不是说也门航空
I'm not talking about Yemenia Air.

247
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,480
我看上的
I have my eyes

248
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,880
是另一架
on a different set of wings.

249
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
妈妈
Mom?

250
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
萨拉
Sara!

251
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,790
太突然了
You scared us.

252
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,000
-抱歉  -一切都好吗
- Sorry. - Is everything all right?

253
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,400
好 一切都好 我只是... 今天有点凌乱
Yeah, no, It's fine. I just... it's been a crazy day,

254
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,600
差点忘了迈克要上西语课
made more so by the fact that I forgot Mike's Spanish lesson.

255
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,080
-西班牙语  -对
- Spanish? - Yeah.

256
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,190
-不是今天  -我们车上说好吗
- That's not today. - We're gonna talk about it in the car, okay?

257
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,800
你确定吗 真的没事吗
Are you sure? Is everything okay?

258
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,680
真的 我们没事 谢谢
Really. Yes. We're fine. Thank you.

259
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,090
我去拿迈克的包
Well, let me get Mike's bag.

260
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,200
不用了 放着吧 我明天来拿
No, no, don't worry about it. I'll get it tomorrow.

261
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,980
不管发生什么都别下车
I want you to get in the car and no matter what...

262
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,480
别出来好吗
You don't get out, okay?

263
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,000
你急匆匆地要去哪里
Where you going so fast?

264
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,310
进去
Get in.

265
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,490
谢谢
Thank you.

266
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,010
昨天的部门会议怎么样
How was that department meeting yesterday?

267
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,810
你经常见杀手吗
You usually meet with killers?

268
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,080
萨拉 比激动 听我说
Sara. Sara. Please, please, please.

269
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,300
我能解释 好吗 听我说
I can explain, okay? Just listen to me.

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,500
我受够了担惊受怕
I was sick with worry.

271
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,400
我得保护你 保护我们的家庭
I needed to protect you, to-to protect our family,

272
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,200
所以我从店里拿着你的手机
so I picked up your phone from the shop

273
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,400
带给安德鲁·纳尔逊
and I took it to Andrew Nelson,

274
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,510
我有个朋友在计算机科学系
my buddy in the computer sciences department.

275
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,710
他深度调查了
He did a deep dive,

276
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,710
什么数据探索之类的
some kind of data archaeology, and he did it.

277
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,270
他查到了那些混蛋的位置
He tracked those bastards down.

278
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,890
和联系方式
Got their cell information.

279
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,300
所以我就联系了他们
So... so I called them,

280
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,480
我以为可以
thinking I could... I could maybe

281
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,980
-跟他们谈条件  -你居然给他们打电话
- make a make a deal with them. - You called them.

282
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,710
萨拉
Sara?

283
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,390
萨拉 求你了 听我解释
Sara, please, listen to me.

284
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,480
萨拉 我是为了你啊
Sara, this was for you.

285
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,190
起开 别挡路
You're gonna want to get out of the way right now.

286
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,190
萨拉 萨拉
Sara. Sara!

287
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,880
到了
This is it.

288
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,500
这是我们逃出去的机会
Our ticket out of the country.

289
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,800
我跟你说迈克尔 这主意可馊
I'm telling you, Michael, this is a bad idea.

290
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,410
到处都是伊斯兰国的人
ISIL are everywhere.

291
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,200
不 我能做到
No, I can do this.

292
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,390
你真的花了一千万里亚尔
You really paid the equivalent of ten million rial

293
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,680
买人的骨灰吗
for some dude's ashes?

294
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
那可不是普通人 兄弟
Not just any ashes, man.

295
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,300
那可是弗雷迪·墨库里[皇后乐队的主唱]
Freddie Mercury's ashes.

296
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,600
翻两倍我也愿意买
I would've paid twice that.

297
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,000
走了
Come on.

298
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,870
低头
Keep your head down.

299
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,600
我们别再疯了 该去机场了
I think it's time we get sane and head to the airport.

300
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,000
不 不行
No, no, no.

301
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,700
这儿更好 他们控制着机场
This is better. They control the station.

302
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,000
最危险的地方就是最安全的地方
They'll never think to look for us here now.

303
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,360
火车是用来运货的
They're repurposing those trains for cargo,

304
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,610
不坐人
not passengers.

305
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,910
我们一旦上去了 就...
Once we're on, it's...

306
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,690
就是一路向北
it's a straight shot to the north.

307
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,810
他们不会再检查车厢
They won't check the cars again.

308
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
你见着火车就想到这些?
That's what you see when you see the train?

309
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,790
我只看到一堆拿着突击步枪的
I see a bunch of dudes with AK-47s

310
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,990
异国人 你真的以为
who don't look a thing like us. You really believe

311
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,380
咱们能逃上火车跑300英里吗
we can survive 300 miles on a train

312
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,990
还要穿过伊斯兰国的地盘呢
through ISIL territory?

313
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,580
这根本是自杀
Now that's suicide.

314
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,290
是有风险 不开玩笑
It does seem risky. No kidding.

315
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,390
不行
No, no.

316
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,390
只要上到那些车厢里 别抬头
We get in that line of cargo carriers. Keep our heads down.

317
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,480
上车后全程小心翼翼就好
Once we're on the train, lay low the rest of the trip.

318
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,400
再说了 我们不用跟他们一样
Besides, we don't need to look like them.

319
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,110
告诉那些信徒不要抬头
Tell the believing men to lower their gaze

320
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,490
并保持谦虚
and be modest.

321
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
快走
Come on.

322
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,700
可兰经的
From the Koran.

323
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,690
所有的路都封死了
All the roads are blocked.

324
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,500
所以得另辟蹊径逃去边境
So you'll have to find a different way to the border.

325
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,580
坐火车
By train!

326
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,600
希瑟 现在怎么办
Heather, what now?

327
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,080
什么怎么办
What now?

328
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,100
这就是个骗局 不是吗
I mean, it was all a lie. Wasn't it?

329
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,280
都是骗我的 我们的生活 婚姻
Everything. Our whole life, our whole marriage.

330
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,820
他和你都和我那么亲近
He was standing as close as you were to me right now,

331
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,390
他居然和射伤他的女人谈话
and he was chatting with the woman who shot him.

332
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,180
你是说他故意受伤
You're saying he planned to get himself shot

333
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,790
演给你看苦肉计吗
like it was some sort of, uh, sick performance?

334
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,500
我不知道 真的不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

335
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,000
就是 我...
I mean, I...

336
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,290
-对 对 就是那样  -但是他差点就死了
- Yes. Yes, it was. - But he almost died.

337
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,200
可能原计划是轻伤 对吧
So, the plan was to wing him, right?

338
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,200
只是为了让他洗清嫌疑 但是打偏了
To just put him above suspicion, but the shot went wide.

339
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,000
他被射中了
He gets hit.

340
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,180
-他知道自己娶了个医生 -萨拉 够了 停下
-He knows that he's married to a doctor.  -Sara, Sara, stop. Stop.

341
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,910
你已经三天没睡了吧
You haven't slept in three days, right?

342
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,190
那些人闯进你家
You're upset about the home invasion

343
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,690
你还得知自己的挚爱
and you're tying yourself up in knots

344
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,480
孩子的父亲 可能还活着
because the love of your life,

345
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,000
所以你很痛苦 很纠结
the father of your baby, might be alive.

346
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,310
林肯的电话也打不通
And I can't get through to Lincoln.

347
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,000
但是我看了视频
But I saw that video.

348
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,700
就是他
It's him.

349
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,180
- 好了 我...  -真的是迈克尔
- Okay, and I... - That's Michael.

350
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,400
我相信你 真的信
And I believe you. I do.

351
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,640
这很重要
And that matters.

352
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,080
这是最重要的
That's all that matters.

353
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,290
不 我知道
No, I know.

354
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,480
但雅各布是个好人
But Jacob is a good man.

355
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,000
他是你的丈夫
He's your husband.

356
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,000
-是啊  -他牵着你开始新生活
- Yeah. - And he helped you start a new life.

357
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
携手并肩
Together.

358
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,280
他来电话了
And that's him.

359
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,330
-我得接一下  -不 不要
- I have to answer it. - No. No.

360
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,800
-不要接  -请留言 稍后回电
- No, you don't. - Leave a message and we'll get back.

361
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,100
希瑟 希瑟 萨拉在你那儿吗
Heather, Heather? Is Sara there?

362
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,000
求你了 我想和她谈谈
Please, I-I need to speak with her.

363
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,480
这就是个误会
Look, there's been a huge misunderstanding

364
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,770
我能解释清楚的
and I can explain everything.

365
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,480
你能... 能告诉她吗
Will you just... Will you tell her that?

366
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,300
让她打给我
And to call me?

367
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,360
他在跟踪我
He's tracking me.

368
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,580
天啊 萨拉 亲爱的 我是你最好的朋友
Oh, Sara, honey. I'm your best friend.

369
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,800
他当然会先给我打了
Of course he's gonna call here first.

370
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,490
这不证明他是"深喉"
It doesn't make him Deep Throat.

371
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:06,200
我们该往好的方面去想
Listen, let's just see if there's a simpler explanation.

372
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,300
好
Okay.

373
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,810
他跟你说那个技术员叫什么
What was the name of that computer tech that he mentioned?

374
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,500
安德鲁
Andrew.

375
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,400
纳尔逊 安德鲁·纳尔逊
Nelson. Andrew Nelson.

376
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,310
好 我有个老朋友是那个部门的
Okay, well, I have an old friend in that department.

377
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,300
一通电话就能知道雅各布是不是在说谎
We can find out if Jacob's full of it in one call.

378
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,590
好的
Okay.

379
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,980
赶紧去火车另一边
Get on the other side of that train!

380
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,000
快 快跑 快点啊
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!

381
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,380
快快 咱们走
Come on, let's go.

382
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,890
你要干什么
What do you want?

383
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,900
看我给你发的照片
Look at the picture I just sent you.

384
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,080
我正看着那些杀人犯
I can see the murderers now.

385
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,790
他们在哪儿
Where?

386
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,480
先别急
Not so fast.

387
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,300
带上武器 我跟着他们
Bring your weapons, I will stay on them.

388
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,440
现在都听我指挥
And I call the shots now.

389
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,070
我们检查了 汽油足够我们飞出也门
We checked. There's enough fuel to get us out of Yemen.

390
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,400
问题是 你能把这老鸟飞上天吗
Question is, can you fly an old bird like this?

391
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,910
到时候就知道了
We'll find out.

392
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,990
萨那外30英里还有个车站
There's another station, 30 miles outside Sana'a.

393
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,890
我们可以在那里想办法上火车
We can find a way there, hop a train.

394
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,280
他们绝对想不到的
They won't anticipate us coming that way.

395
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,300
往一手烂牌上加注
Doubling down on a bad bet.

396
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,580
七年前你也做过 不过斗的是中情局
Just like you did seven years back with the CIA.

397
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,080
看看四周
Look around you.

398
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,690
你的计划连累了这么多人 自己还不知道
Your plans affect people, you don't even see it.

399
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,400
你怨我 我不怪你
I don't blame you for resenting me.

400
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,870
对 我就是怨你
You're damn right I resent you.

401
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,400
我知道 林肯 我懂
I see it, Linc. I see it.

402
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,580
每时每刻我都知道
Every second of every day,

403
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,400
那些被我牵连的人
the people, the collateral damage,

404
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,400
我害死... 的那些生命
the lives I've... affected.

405
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,430
但我不能想
But I can't start thinking about that.

406
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,300
要是一想
Because if I do,

407
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,180
就会崩溃 那我们都回不了家
then it all falls apart and none of us get to go home.

408
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,000
我必须要集中
I have to stay focused,

409
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,780
做个运筹帷幄的人
be the man with the plan.

410
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,870
就像在福克斯河监狱一样
Just like Fox River.

411
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,590
还记得么
Remember?

412
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,900
车子到手了
We got wheels.

413
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,000
干得漂亮
Good work.

414
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,880
去机场才是最佳选择
The airport's the only play.

415
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,080
机场只离我们八公里远
The airport is five miles away.

416
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,500
开去边界有一百六十多公里
The border is hundreds.

417
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,780
听着 机场可能是最佳选择
Look, the airport might be the right choice,

418
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,980
但我还是坚持我的直觉
but I trust my instincts.

419
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,790
他们关了我们这么久
They've gotten us this far.

420
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,010
直觉告诉我 我们能从北边逃走
And my gut says we can still make it out through the north.

421
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,480
看你们自己选了
Choice is yours.

422
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,120
就算你我跟你不熟 我也同意的你的意见
Look, man, I agree with you, even if I don't know you from Adam.

423
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,900
但是...
But...

424
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,890
既然马带你来这里你就应该继续跟着马出去 懂吗 所以...
got to go with the horse that got you here, you know? So...

425
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,990
他就是我的马
he's my horse.

426
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,480
这么疯的马我还从没见过
Craziest horse I've ever met.

427
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,100
但带我们走到了现在
But got us this far.

428
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,590
你是没死才敢说
Crazy only works

429
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,100
疯狂会起作用这种话
if it doesn't get you killed.

430
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,310
安德鲁
Andrew?

431
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,100
海登教授叫我们来跟你聊聊
Professor Hayden told us to speak with you?

432
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,070
对的 是我
Oh, yeah. Uh, yeah, right.

433
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,680
不好意思
Sorry.

434
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,500
你好 安德鲁
Hi, Andrew.

435
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,100
我是萨拉·斯科菲尔德
I'm Sara Scofield.

436
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,800
感谢你能抽出时间来
Thanks for taking the time.

437
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,480
能不能告诉我
By any chance,

438
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,000
我丈夫雅各布·尼斯请你研究我的手机了吗
did my husband Jacob Ness ask you to work on my cell phone?

439
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,590
有的 昨天叫的
Yeah, he did yesterday.

440
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,300
他叫你...
What did he, uh...

441
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,710
他叫你做什么了
What did he ask you to do?

442
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,290
他说他想找到是谁一直追踪他的妻子
Uh, he said he was looking to find the contact information

443
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,200
并且让我找出这些人的联系方式
for the people who were stalking his wife.

444
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,990
然后我就下载了份我能查到的数据给他
So I did a data dive and gave him what I could find.

445
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,960
怎么查到的
How?

446
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,190
他们黑进了你的手机并且留下了相关数据
They hacked your phone and lifted the data,

447
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,630
但在这一步骤里 他们留下了一个微小的电子签名
but in the process, left a very slight electronic signature

448
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,780
这样我就可以反向追踪他们
that I was able to track back to them.

449
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,790
等等 "他们"是谁
Wait, who are "They"?

450
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,590
我也不知道 是个虚假IP地址
Don't know. It was a dummy IP address,

451
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,790
但是手机信号和地址是对的
but the cell and location were correct.

452
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,380
在我面前这些都得显现原形
They couldn't hide that from me.

453
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,100
还是你老公
The man himself.

454
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,680
好啊
Hello.

455
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,810
萨拉 听我说 我知道你很伤心
Sara, listen, I know you're upset,

456
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:41,500
但我想你来趟惠特尼海茨警局
but I need you to come to the Whitney Heights police station,

457
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,560
现在
right now.

458
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,890
拜托你了
Please.

459
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,740
现在我们有时间可以聊聊了
So, now we got some time to talk.

460
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,300
你本名叫迈克尔
Well, your name's Michael.

461
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,200
行
Cool.

462
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,200
你有个哥哥
You have a brother.

463
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,210
还有什么是我不知道的
What else don't I know?

464
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,000
说真的 我想知道 我已经逃了这么久
Serious, I need to know. I've been traveling so fast,

465
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,070
目前为止 我一直在想你究竟是谁
for so long, I didn't even stop to think who you really are

466
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,570
或者在想我们究竟在这干什么
or what we're real doing here.

467
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,980
我甚至不知道
I don't even know why

468
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,600
为什么你要把我拉进来
you dragged me into all this, you know?

469
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,880
你得忘记过去的一切 维普 所有的事情
You got to forget the past, Whip, the details.

470
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,390
一切都不重要了
None of that matters now.

471
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,600
我在这几年做了些什么
What have my actions been all these years?

472
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,380
是谁一直在照顾你
Who's been taking care of you through everything, huh?

473
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,280
是我 对吗
Me. Right?

474
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,900
是不是
Right?

475
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,310
是啊
Yeah.

476
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,600
没有任何变化
Nothing changes.

477
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,690
你还是我的小鞭子
You're still my whip hand...

478
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,600
小鞭子 对 是你的小鞭子
Whip hand, yeah, I know, I'm your whip hand.

479
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,100
只是... 这次真不行了
It's... it's not good enough this time, man.

480
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,690
你能不能直说了
Can you just give it to me straight?

481
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,090
我是个成年人了 我能接受事实
You know, I'm a big boy, I can handle it.

482
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:49,080
你能成为我的小鞭子是有原因的
There's a reason you're my whip hand.

483
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,410
这个原因足以改变你的命运
A reason that's gonna change your life.

484
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,010
在旅途的终点有重大转折在等着你
There's a light at the end of the tunnel for you.

485
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,370
他妈的发生什么了
What the hell was that?

486
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,350
操他妈的
Son of a bitch.

487
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,620
我们得跑了
We got to go.

488
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,610
快跑
Let's go!

489
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,480
-没有路了  -医院的后门
- There's no way out. - Back of the hospital's

490
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,090
被石头堵住了 没有路
been shelled to rubble. It's blocked.

491
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,800
楼上也被封锁了
Upstairs is blocked, too.

492
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,500
我们去楼下
We're gonna go downstairs.

493
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,390
看看有没有路出去
Look for a way out.

494
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,500
你也一样
You do the same.

495
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,000
谢谢
Thanks.

496
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,490
发生什么事了
What's going on?

497
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,020
萨拉 你...
Sara, just...

498
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,700
你跟我们走
just come with us.

499
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,590
就知道发生什么了
You'll see. Please.

500
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,180
你好 女士 是萨拉·斯科菲尔德吗
Hello, ma'am. Um, Sara Scofield?

501
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,200
是的 警官
Yes, sir.

502
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,000
感谢您能前来 我是凯南警探
Thanks for coming in, I'm Detective Kennan.

503
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,480
我们想请你指认出闯进你家的嫌疑犯
We'd like you to point out who broke into your home.

504
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,480
然后...
And...

505
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,690
谁开枪打伤了你的丈夫
the one who shot your husband.

506
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,390
三号和四号
It's three and four.

507
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,220
那个男人和女人是枪手
The man and the woman was the shooter.

508
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,880
你确定吗
Are you sure?

509
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,490
我确定 警官
Yes, sir.

510
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,800
我十分确定
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.

511
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,070
这肯定有路能出去
There's got to be a way out.

512
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,370
肯定有... 有链接路面的通道
Something... something that connects to the surface.

513
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,600
往下走没有用的 迈克尔
Going down's not gonna work, Michael.

514
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,380
我们应该直接设埋伏 然后奋起反击
We need to set up an ambush and fight.

515
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,800
打架是你的惯用方式
Yeah, well, fighting is your default setting.

516
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,200
但不用总这样
It's not always about fists.

517
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,910
那我就这么跟你说 这里没有路出去
I'm telling you, there's no way out.

518
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,990
那就找些能打架的东西 你个蠢货
Then find something to fight with, you idiot.

519
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,310
这可不是什么轰趴
I don't think it's that kind of a party,

520
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,890
但我喜欢你的风格
but I like your style.

521
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,200
你想拿这个做什么
What are you going to do with that?

522
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,400
我也不知道
I don't know.

523
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,000
先给他们一下子
Beats a fist.

524
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,010
医用酒精吗
Rubbing alcohol?

525
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,390
你他妈的在干啥
What the hell are you doing?

526
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,800
你会瞎的 傻逼
You'll go blind, you idiot.

527
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,890
这只含百分之九十五的酒精
It's only 95% alcohol.

528
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,890
我只会瞎百分之九十五
I'll only go 95% blind.

529
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,700
这里 这里有个通风井
There. There's an air shaft.

530
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,680
好吧 现在要开始动拳头了
Well, it's about fists now.

531
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
迈克尔
Michael?

532
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,300
不好 他们来了
No. It's them.

533
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,400
我的初恋比我大很多
My first lover was much older than me.

534
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,790
他是我朋友的爸爸
He was my friend's father.

535
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,880
他叫玛希
Massi was his name.

536
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,290
这是我跟他之间的秘密
It was the greatest of scandals

537
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,690
也是最大的丑闻
that we kept to ourselves.

538
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,090
但他的妻子发现了我们的关系
But his wife discovered us

539
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,890
然后告诉了她的兄弟们
and told her brothers.

540
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,700
他们把玛希带去了沙漠...
Massi was taken into the desert...

541
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,700
然后把活埋了
and buried.

542
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
活活烧死的
Alive.

543
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,980
他们还用一块破布包着他的眼睛给了我
They brought his eyes to me in a rag.

544
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,390
我请求你用这个杀了我
I need you to use that on me.

545
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,800
结束我的苦难
End my suffering.

546
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:09,870
用这个吗
What, this?

547
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,680
贾 说得对 这些逃亡没有任何意义
Ja's right. All this running is pointless.

548
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,090
你知道到了那里 他们会对我做什么吗
Do you know what they will do to me here,

549
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,800
那些人
away from seeing eyes?

550
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,600
我做不到
I can't.

551
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,320
我不会让这发生的
I won't let that happen.

552
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,800
听见了吗
Do you understand?

553
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,780
我不会让它发生的
I won't let that happen.

554
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,480
听着 希德
Listen. Sid.

555
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,780
我不会放弃的
I'm not giving up.

556
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,690
和同性恋无关 你也不许放弃
And queer or no, you're not, either.

557
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,120
错的是他们
They're in the wrong.

558
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,900
不是你
Not you.

559
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,080
你准备用这做什么
What are you gonna do with that?

560
00:32:53,990 --> 00:33:01,990
一次又一次 我付出所得
I've paid my dues. Time after time .

561
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:07,600
我已经服满刑期 但我并没有犯罪
I've served my sentence. But committed no crime...

562
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
迈克尔 拜托
Michael, come on.

563
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,110
对不起 林肯
I'm sorry, Linc.

564
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,800
我应该在你身边的
I should have come to you.

565
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,300
我不应该找你帮忙的
I should've asked for your help

566
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,210
当波塞顿跟我谈条件时 我搞砸了它
when Poseidon offered me the deal. I blew it.

567
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,200
当时 我想
At the time, I thought,

568
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,690
如果我自己能解决 那所有的痛苦都由我一人承担
if I dealt with it myself, the pain would only be mine.

569
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:43,400
但是相反 我打开的是潘多拉的盒子
But instead I opened this Pandora's Box.

570
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,230
我想要一切变好 但我只是让一切都变得更糟了
I wanted to make it better, but I only made it worse

571
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,990
对每个人
for everyone.

572
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,980
在那里...
And somewhere in there...

573
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,800
我变成了鬼魂
I became a ghost.

574
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
我犯了太多错误
I made a lot of mistakes.

575
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,810
做了太多愚蠢的 不完美的选择
A lot of foolish, imperfect choices,

576
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,600
但是每一个选择...
but every one of them...

577
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,990
我的每一次选择都是为了爱
every one of them I made for love.

578
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,680
我知道 我知道
I know. I know.

579
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
迈克尔
Michael,

580
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,410
你是我见过的最聪明的人
you're the smartest person I've ever known,

581
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:48,280
但你不能独自承担一切
but you can't carry the load on your shoulders alone.

582
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,510
我可以帮你分担
You need to share the burden.

583
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,260
嗯
Yes.

584
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,600
这才是家人
That's family.

585
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,280
这才是家人的意义
That's what family's for.

586
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,300
莎拉 我不知道你在想什么 但是...
Sara, I don't know what you thought, but...

587
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:03,190
我只是一个担心自己妻子的丈夫
I'm just a husband who was worried about his wife.

588
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,900
没错 我应该告诉你我在做什么 但是...
And yeah, I-I should have told you what I was doing, but...

589
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,310
听着 我感觉... 所有事都盘旋着
Look, I felt like... like everything was spiraling

590
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,200
超出了控制 我必须尽我所能保护你
out of control and I had to do whatever I could to protect you.

591
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,680
所以你觉得你能和两个雇佣杀手谈判
So you thought you'd contact two hired killers?

592
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,190
我只是想成为你的白衣骑士
I was trying to play the white knight.

593
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,700
虽然没有做好
Not very well.

594
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,510
而且这很疯狂
And it was insanity.

595
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,780
我害怕死亡
I was scared to death.

596
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,790
我真蠢
A blubbering idiot,

597
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,900
但我觉得他们想要的是钱 你明白吗
but I thought they would respond to money, you know?

598
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,080
给他们足够的钱打发走他们
Pay them whatever it took to make them go away.

599
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
超过他们的赏金
More than they were already making:

600
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,380
五万美金
$50,000.

601
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,480
听着 我...
Look, I, uh...

602
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,580
我放了追踪器在里面 莎拉
I had a tracker in it, Sara.

603
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:46,600
这块小东西 但是他们没有得到钱
This little thing, but they didn't touch it.

604
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
我在见面前联系了警察
I contacted the police before the meet,

605
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:54,400
但不管怎样 我们抓到了他们
but we nailed them anyhow.

606
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,210
我们抓到他们了
We nailed them.

607
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,000
雅各布
Jacob.

608
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,590
真的对不起 连累你经历这些
I am so sorry I put you through this.

609
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,000
动手吧
Let's do this.

610
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,990
一把扳手和一根钢管 对抗AK步枪
A wrench and a pipe against AKs.

611
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,690
会很有趣
It'll be fun.

612
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,200
我一直想砸烂这些杂种
I've always wanted a crack at these bastards.

Whatever. I still love you.

633

伊斯兰国的人就像螳螂一样
ISIL are like roaches.

More will be here soon.

635
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,680
我们现在怎么办
What do we do now?

636
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,980
我需要休息一下 再做决定
I need to take a break from making decisions.

637
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,810
林肯 机场那边呢
Linc, airport?

638
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:15,900
机场
Airport.

639
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,480
我找到了某个人 我想你们谈谈
I got someone I want you to talk to.

640
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,410
噢 兄弟
Oh, man!

641
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,910
我以为我再也听不到这个声音了
Now that's a voice I never thought I'd hear again.

642
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,800
你得解释一下了 兄弟
Man, you got some explaining to do, brother,

643
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
-你的死而复生  -很快
- risen from the dead and all. - Soon.

644
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,970
我们在哪碰面
Where can we meet you?

645
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,290
二号机库 主跑道右侧
Uh, hangar two. Right off the main runway.

646
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,890
但你最好快点
But you better hurry your ass up.

647
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:43,800
二号机库
Hangar two?

648
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,200
20分钟 我们能到那里
We could be there in 20 minutes.

649
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,880
我们20分钟后到
We can be there in 20 minutes.

650
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,090
我不知道是否能等那么久
I don't know if we have that long.

651
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,910
等我们 我们会到那
Wait for us. We'll be there.

652
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,180
我们得走了
We got to move.

653
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,890
希德...
Sid...

654
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
希德...
Sid!

655
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,100
我听到你的电话了 异教徒
I heard your call, infidel.

656
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,190
飞机不会带你们去安全的地方
Wings will not carry you to safety.

657
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,990
一个电话 我的兄弟们
One call, and my brothers

658
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,400
就会找到你们在机场的朋友

660

661
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,620
不 不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no, no.

662
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,180
别死 希德 别离开我们
Talk to me, Sid. Stay with us.

663
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,880
别离开我们
Stay with us.

664
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,110
希德
Sid...

665
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,500
希德
Sid.

666
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,790
他死了
He's gone.

667
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,190
别在他身上浪费时间
Don't waste yourself on him.

668
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,390
活下去随时都可以揍他
You'll beat him by surviving.

669
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,410
你们马上就会死 听见了吗
You will die, you hear me?

670
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,110
你们都会死
You will all die!

671
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,600
我的...
Oh, my...

672
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,270
他们把更多的卡车开到跑道上了
They're moving more trucks into position.

673
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,210
-嗯  -我们不能等了
- Yeah. - We can't wait.

674
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,100
没有足够的跑道起飞了 我们现在必须走了
There won't be enough runway to take off. We must go now.

675
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,980
我欠林肯一条命 他值得更好的生活
I owe Lincoln my life. He deserves better.

676
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,490
但是这么多生命在我们手里
But with so many souls in our hands,

677
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,300
我们真的有选择吗
do we really have a choice?

678
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:01,020
听着 我们再等五分钟
Listen, we wait five more minutes.

679
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,990
好吗
Okay?

680
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,900
到那时 我们只救走我们能救的人
And then we take care of the souls that we can.

681
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,090
明白了吗
Understand?

682
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,000
该死的 你在做什么
What the hell are you doing?

683
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,480
你到底在搞什么
The hell are you doing?

684
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,480
听着 我们不会丢下我的朋友的
Listen, we are not leaving my friends!

685
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,080
关掉它 关掉
Shut it down. Shut it down!

686
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,490
你会害死我们全部人
You would condemn us all to death.

687
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:28,580
如果你阻止我 没人能活着出去
If you stop me, no one gets out.

688
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,390
你的朋友能继续寻找安全的地方 但我们不行
Your friends can still make it to safety. We will not.

689
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:59,190
嗯
Yeah?

690
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,800
C-Note 你必须得走了
C-Note? You got to get out of here, man.

691
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:06,100
不 不 不 不 我们不能这么做 我们不能这么做
Hey, no, no, no, no. W-We can do this thing, man. We can do it.

692
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:09,400
不 现在就走 否则你和那些孩子都会死
No! Go now! Otherwise, you and the kids are dead!

693
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,400
我们会想办法的
We'll work something out.

694
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,780
不会更糟了
We've been through worse.

695
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,190
林肯 我很抱歉
Linc, I'm so sorry.

696
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,690
我真的很抱歉 兄弟
I'm so sorry, brother.

697
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,690
林肯 找到奥马尔 他...
Lincoln? Find Omar. He...

698
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,590
什么
