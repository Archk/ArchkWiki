"越狱"前情提要...
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,480
失去弟弟 给你的人生留下巨大的创伤
Losing a brother,the massive hole that leaves in your life.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,860
和失去丈夫一样
Like the same massive hole

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,530
留下了巨大的创伤
losing a husband makes.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,820
-你弟弟已经死了  -那这怎么解释
- Your brother's dead, Lincoln. - How do you explain that?

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,330
-林肯·布鲁斯  -雅各布
- Lincoln Burrows.- Jacob.

7
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,940
-林肯叔叔  -嘿
- Uncle Lincoln! ‭- Hey!

8
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,520
911吗 有人持枪入闯入了我的屋子
911. I have an armed intruder in my house.

9
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,860
我们触发了一些事...
We've awoken something...

10
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,930
一些想被藏起来的 跟迈克有关的事
something people are trying to hide about Michael.

11
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,340
我都不知道我们在跟谁拼命
I don't know who we're fighting.

12
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,690
我们去也门 把事情搞清楚
Let's go to Yemen and find out.

13
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,200
你他妈一点都不了解也门
You don't know a damn thing about Yemen.

14
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,380
那我就去找个了解也门的人
I'll find someone who does.

15
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,380
这个国家四分五裂了 每个人都想走
The country's falling apart. Everyone wants out.

16
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,470
欢迎加入内战
Welcome to the civil war.

17
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,760
快走 不然我们都得死
Come quickly, or we'll all be dead!

18
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,640
-中间人是谁来着  -一个叫希巴的女人
- Who's that contact again?- A woman named Sheba.

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,060
迈克尔惹上大麻烦了脱不开身
Michael's caught in the middle of something big.

20
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,680
坎尼尔·奥提斯
Kaniel Outis is

21
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,100
-可是个知名的恐怖分子  -我们安排
- a big-time terrorist. - We've arranged

22
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,440
去奥杰吉厄监狱探监
a visit to Ogygia Prison.

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,860
那意思是迈克尔在里面 吗
That mean Michael's in there?

24
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,730
迈克尔
Michael?

25
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,030
我的名字不是迈克尔 我也不认识你
My name isn't Michael, and I don't know who you are.

26
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,990
迈克 你在做什么 该死的
Michael, what are you doing, damn it?!

27
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,220
随着伊斯兰国部队靠近国会大厦
The fighting in Yemen intensified today

28
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,680
也门的战斗愈演愈烈
as ISIL forces get ever nearer to the capitol.

29
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,970
声称要接管这个国家
The rebels, who have the stated intent of taking over the country

30
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,910
建立伊斯兰国的反动派
and establishing a radical caliphate,

31
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,240
也下决心要让他们的领袖获释
are also bent on freeing their leader,

32
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,090
阿布·拉马尔 5年前被政府擒获
Abu Ramal, who was captured by the government five years ago.

33
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,340
拉马尔以其极端言行著称
Ramal is known for his extreme views and practices,

34
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,590
他把年轻女孩当性奴
from using young girls as sex slaves,

35
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,710
像中世纪执法一样公开斩首
to a medieval brand of justice that includes public beheadings

36
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,220
当街处决囚犯
and executions in the street.

37
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,180
拉马尔目前被关押在
Ramal is currently being held in

38
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,770
也门最臭名昭著的监狱 奥杰吉厄监狱
Yemen's most notorious penitentiary, Ogygia Prison.

39
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,350
就现在了
This is it.

40
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,140
维普 快点上来
Whip, get up here.

41
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,480
开始了吗
Is it happening?

42
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,880
你不会丢下我们不管 对吗
You are not going to leave us, are you?

43
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,370
如果反动派占领这座城市
If the rebels take the city,

44
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,200
我们死定了
we're dead.

45
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,830
你跟我们说了不下千次了
You've told us that a thousand times,

46
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,360
锡德 你老是问同样的问题 我的回答还不明白吗
Sid. You're a broken record. Is it clear?

47
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,490
好 我明白
Okay, it's clear.

48
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,280
维普 快
Whip. Come on.

49
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,410
我们出去... 你跟上
Let's go out... you follow.

50
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,870
快
Come on.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,670
如果像别的越狱一样
Would have made it so much easier

52
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,090
就只有我跟你两个人 会不会容易很多
if it was just you and me like it was on all the other ones.

53
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,010
这次越狱没有任何环节容易
Nothing is easy on this one.

54
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,060
对 跟我说说
Yeah, tell me about it.

55
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,520
还有一分钟
One minute.

56
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,850
拿板子跨过缺口
Board spans the gap.

57
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,230
好
Okay.

58
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,400
毯子包着电线
Blanket covers the wire.

59
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,820
现在就等停电了
Now it's about those lights going out.

60
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,120
他24小时前没有闪过灯
He didn't flash it 24 hours before.

61
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,410
-本来应该有闪灯信号的  -有点信心
- That's supposed to be the signal. ‭- Have faith.

62
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,200
连续7天吗
Seven straight nights?

63
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,370
没有信号 灯也没熄过
No signal, no lights getting turned out?

64
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,750
伊斯兰国的攻击也越来越近了
Those strikes are getting closer, too.

65
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,260
探照灯没有熄
Those lights aren't going out.

66
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,640
-灯没有熄  -得回去了
- Lights aren't going out. - ‭Got to go back.

67
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,720
也许我们可以跑过去试试
Maybe make a run for it.

68
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,600
太远了 我们跑到缺口之前
Too much ground to cover. They'll shoot us down

69
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,680
-就被他们射杀  -那之后计划是什么 放弃还是等死
- before we make the gap - What's the plan then? Give up and die?

70
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,270
我不能再等多4年了
I can't wait another four years.

71
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,150
本来说好是一周内出去的
It was supposed to be one week.

72
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,560
波塞冬把我们留下来等死
Poseidon has left us here to die.

73
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,400
我们手上还有一张牌
‭We still got one card left to play.

74
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,690
我不想用掉 但已经准备用了
I didn't want to play it, but it's already in motion.

75
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
走吧
Let's go.

76
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,380
显然 坎尼尔·奥提斯因为对抗政府
Apparently, Kaniel Outis was thrown into Ogygia

77
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,290
被扔进了奥杰吉厄监狱
for crimes against the government.

78
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,500
不久后
Shortly after, he was captured

79
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,540
又试图逃跑 被扔进了单间
trying to escape, and thrown into solitary.

80
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,750
他们最近才把他放回多人间
They just released him into gen pop recently.

81
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,300
称他为迈克尔 好吗
Call him Michael, will you?

82
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,380
但为什么他看见我们的时候
But why didn't he acknowledge us

83
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,050
说不认识我们
when he saw us?

84
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,440
站住
Stop!

85
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,660
回来
Get back here!

86
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,180
有小孩在监视我们
Kid was spying on us.

87
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,330
在门垫下留了点东西
And he left something under the doormat.

88
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,710
是迈克尔的笔迹
It's Michael's handwriting.

89
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,770
这是他的标志 他在联系我们
This one's his calling card. He is reaching out to us.

90
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,250
他为什么这么神秘
But why is he being so mysterious?

91
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,290
以前 他也是不直接跟你说
Back in the day, he never

92
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,130
而是用密码的方式吗
talked to you straight, as in not in code?

93
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,710
他担心有人会拦截他的信息
He's worried about someone intercepting his message.

94
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,630
但那是什么意思
Yeah, but what does it mean?

95
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,550
我不知道 但我们应该知道
I don't know, but we're supposed to know.

96
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,890
-"光之酋长"  -光之酋长
- "Sheik of Light."- ‭Sheik of Light.

97
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,390
像是某个在山顶的男人
That sounds like a guy on a mountain peak

98
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,020
在跟上帝交流
communing with God.

99
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,140
我们得寻求帮助
Yeah, we got to get help.

100
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,440
-没人帮我们了  -希巴
- We're out of help. ‭- Sheba.

101
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,860
她觉得我在教唆一个恐怖分子
She's thinks I'm abetting a terrorist.

102
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,030
那你就得说服她你没有
Well, then you have to convince her that you're not.

103
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,240
你得走了 爸爸
You have got to leave, Papa.

104
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,530
-我不会跑的  -政府已经被锁定了
- I will not run away.- The government is being targeted.

105
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,160
你已经被锁定了
You are being targeted.

106
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,660
-我只是一个无名小卒  -你对他们来说也代表政府
- I'm a no one.- You are government to them.

107
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,060
你不理解作为一个也门人
You don't understand being a Yemeni.

108
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,920
怎么会在国家最需要你的时候逃走呢
You would run away when she needs you the most?

109
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,200
我知道 如果我们死了 对这个国家没有任何好处
I understand that we are no good to this country dead.

110
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,320
爸爸 会有机会的 我们去国外
Papa, there will come a time. We go abroad,

111
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,460
重组一个流亡政府
regroup with an exile government.

112
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,180
哪有钱 孩子
With what money, girl?

113
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,780
起码得花两年的薪水
It would cost two years' salary.

114
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,700
比起逃走我宁愿面对敌人 死而无憾
I'd rather die with my face to the enemy than to run away.

115
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,160
爸爸
Papa...

116
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,420
我建议
I suggest you leave

117
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,460
你快点离开这个国家
this country as quickly as you can.

118
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,880
他在这干吗
What's he doing here?

119
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,160
我朋友需要你的帮助
My friend needs your help.

120
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,340
我已经帮过了
I gave him my help.

121
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,300
你没告诉我 他和我的敌人一起工作
You didn't tell me he was working with the enemy.

122
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,400
你口中所说的你的兄弟
This man you claim is your brother,

123
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,000
坎尼尔·奥提斯 他和叛党是一伙的
Kaniel Outis, worked with the rebels.

124
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,580
-他叫迈克尔·斯科菲尔德  -我不管他叫什么
- His name's Michael Scofield. - I don't care!

125
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,200
不是坎尼尔·奥提斯
Not Kaniel Outis!

126
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,550
你说什么都没用
There's nothing you can say to me that will

127
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,120
我是不会帮你的
make me help you, okay?

128
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,300
是吗
Is that right?

129
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,550
这些钱足够能让你的家人离开这个国家吗
This enough to get your family out of the country?

130
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,060
先把我送去这里
Deliver me this first.

131
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,940
准备好了吗 亲爱的
Ready, love?

132
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,940
-那是什么  -那是...是
- What's that? - It's, uh... it's

133
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,860
是林肯叔叔发来的
something your Uncle Lincoln sent.

134
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,500
我不想走 我想和你在一起
I don't want to go. I want to stay with you.

135
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,430
你该去学校了
You got to go to school.

136
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,980
你一放学 我就在这儿等着你
And I'm gonna be right here when the bell rings.

137
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
好吗 然后你走过来
Okay? You walk down those steps,

138
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,360
一脚跳进车里 好吗
you hop straight into the car. Yeah?

139
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,660
我爱你
I love you.

140
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,540
祝你今天愉快
Make it a great day.

141
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,400
我收到了信
I got the note.

142
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,540
迈克尔 我收到了信
I got the note, Michael.

143
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,770
我们会把你救出来的
We're going to get you out of here.

144
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,420
听着 我不叫迈克尔
Look, my name isn't Michael,

145
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,300
我也不认识你
and I don't know who you are.

146
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,740
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,460
你知道我是个著名经济学家吗
You know I'm a noted economist?

148
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,020
我是说 报纸上这么说的
I mean, that's what it says in the paper.

149
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,340
"著名经济学家在家遇袭 "
"Noted Economist Attacked in Home."

150
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,560
我都不知道经济学家还能上新闻
I didn't even know economists made the news.

151
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,320
希望没有下次
That's the first and last time, hopefully.

152
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,010
我试着理顺思路
I've been trying to piece this thing together.

153
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,510
你还记得那些政府的人吗
You remember those government guys,

154
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,380
那些智囊团的人
those think tank guys,

155
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,780
想让我来解决博弈论
trying to pick my brain about game theory,

156
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,060
他们怎么能把那种理论当作外交政策呢
how they could use it for foreign policy?

157
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,140
你非常讨厌他们 对吧
Yeah, you bored the hell out of 'em, right?

158
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,120
是的 不过 我是不是听到了一些
Yeah, okay, but I mean, did I hear something

159
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,620
-我不该听到的事  -我不知道 你听到了吗
- I shouldn't have? - I don't know. Did you?

160
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,120
比如说 谁杀了肯尼迪
Like who shot JFK?

161
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,440
我没开玩笑呢
I am trying to be serious here.

162
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,900
没有 你服用了太多止痛剂
No, you're doped up on painkillers

163
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,570
而且 你想太多了
and you're thinking too much.

164
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,720
我保证 这和你没任何关系
I promise this has nothing to do with you.

165
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,220
你休息吧 我准备去...
You rest. I'm going to ...

166
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,500
出去办点事
I'm gonna run some errands,

167
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,380
然后回去看你 好吗
and then I'm gonna come visit you, okay?

168
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,880
好的 爱你
Okay. Love you.

169
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,040
我也爱你
Love you, too.

170
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,080
好的 没问题 谢谢
Okay, no problem. Thanks.

171
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,060
你好 我...之前打过电话 是有关一个失踪的美国公民
Hi. I...I called earlier about a missing U.S. Citizen

172
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,540
-他现在在中东  -我记得 我是亨利·岸田
- in the Middle East. - Yes. I'm Henry Kishida.

173
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,800
我带你去负责人的办公室
Let me walk you to the director's office.

174
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,360
你的情况有些特殊
It's an unusual situation,

175
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,870
想必你也明白
which you can appreciate,

176
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,040
你丈夫已经公证死亡
since your husband is declared legally dead,

177
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,500
并且你提到的那个人
and the person that you're referring to

178
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,110
用的是另一个名字
goes by another name.

179
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,380
亨利 交给我吧
I'll take it from here, Henry.

180
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,320
莎拉 你怎么样
How are you, Sara?

181
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,950
凯勒曼
Kellerman?

182
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,060
那我就先走了 如果有什么需要 请尽管告诉我
I'll leave you two be. Let me know if you need anything, sir.

183
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,900
抱歉
Sorry, how did I

184
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,100
怎么又是你
end up with you again?

185
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,680
你来请求国务院的帮助
You asked for the State Department's help.

186
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,040
我需要国务院的帮助 不是你的帮助
I wanted the State Department, not you.

187
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,420
你身份太多了
Yeah, you've lived

188
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,960
我不知道你到底是谁
so many lives, I don't know who you are.

189
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,960
对你来说也是一样 不是吗
That'd be a consistent theme for you, wouldn't it, given that

190
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,940
嫁给了一个从没存在过的人
you were married to a man who never existed?

191
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,880
这话什么意思
What is that supposed to mean?

192
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,240
意思是 你应该进去坐坐 让我来开导你
It means you should come in and let me enlighten you

193
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,460
好好讲讲和迈克尔·斯科菲尔德有关的事...
to all things Michael Scofield...

194
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,780
或者说 坎尼尔·奥提斯
Or should I say Kaniel Outis?

195
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,120
最好别喝瓶装水
You shouldn't drink

196
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,300
里面有二恶英 双酚A  [二恶英 有毒 用于塑料制品中 双酚A 有毒 可溶于水]
bottled water...the dioxins, the BPAs in there...

197
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,780
多谢关心
I'm touched by your concern.

198
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,770
坐吧
Have a seat.

199
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,200
不了 谢谢
Good, thank you.

200
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,900
莎拉...
You know, Sara...

201
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,840
我们俩...过去关系波折
...you and I have... a checkered past.

202
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,480
不过 我现在是个无趣的人啦 并且...
But I am evermore a boring guy now, and...

203
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,480
生活让我变得更加沉稳 真的
mellowed by life, trust me.

204
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,080
如果你想告诉我和迈克尔有关的消息
If you have something you want to tell me

205
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,040
我很乐意好好倾听
about Michael, I'd sure love to hear it.

206
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,520
你打电话求助时候 岸田接手了你的事...
Okay. When your call came in and Kishida processed it...

207
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,160
大概是其中出现了些关键词
Well, let's just say there are certain keywords

208
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
让我们不得不注意起来
that get our system buzzing pretty quickly.

209
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,620
坎尼尔·奥提斯...
Kaniel Outis...

210
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
其实
Actually, can't stand it

211
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,180
你那样喝水 我实在是受不了
watching you drink out of that.

212
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,620
岸田
Hey, Kishida?

213
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,740
给莎拉倒杯水 行吗
Could you bring Sara a glass for her water, please?

214
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,480
谢谢你
Thank you.

215
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,810
坎尼尔·奥提斯...
Kaniel Outis...

216
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,970
是个出名的恐怖分子
is a known terrorist,

217
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,840
和伊斯兰国有牵连
ties to ISIL, wanted in the killing

218
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,200
谋杀了一位高级CIA官员
of a senior CIA official.

219
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,560
-迈克尔不是杀手  -看
- Michael's no killer. - You see,

220
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,900
这就是问题所在
that's the problem.

221
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,680
因为坎尼尔·奥提斯就是杀手
Because Kaniel Outis is.

222
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,100
谢谢你
Thank you.

223
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
不客气
You're welcome.

224
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,500
并且...
And...

225
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,570
这是坎尼尔·奥提斯
this is Kaniel Outis.

226
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,140
可笑至极
That's ridiculous.

227
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,070
国务院的档案里
The record here at State says

228
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,940
坎尼尔·奥提斯长这个样
that... that's Kaniel Outis's face.

229
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,180
但你我都清楚迈克尔·斯科菲尔德是谁
but you and I both know who Michael Scofield was.

230
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,380
不 那只是回忆
No, that's just a memory.

231
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,680
现在官方的记录...历史数据...
The official record-- history--

232
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,710
不是那么说的了
it says otherwise now.

233
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,950
现在 想想背后操纵的人真的很可怕
Now, that's scary, to think who could be behind that.

234
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,130
因为只有一个强大的人物
Because only somebody very formidable

235
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,260
才有能力
would be capable

236
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,960
名正言顺地将一个人的身份转换成另一个人的
of officially turning one man into another.

237
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,160
那得是个天才才行...像迈克尔那样的
It would take a genius... like Michael.

238
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,130
你是在暗示我是他干的吗
You're insinuating that he did this?

239
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,970
他消失了
He disappeared,

240
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,970
就这样离他的生活而去吗
just quit on his life?

241
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,570
我和你一样渴求答案
I want answers just like you do.

242
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,770
谁有能力这样做呢
Who's capable of this?

243
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,810
这世界上一共也没几个
Only a handful of people in the world.

244
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,510
萨拉 萨拉
Sara? Sara!

245
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,290
我算了一下 我们大概有一两天的时间
I figure we got a day, maybe two,

246
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,050
最多了 离开这破地方
tops, to get out of this hole.

247
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:06,820
这样看来
At that point,

248
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,440
我们不是死在枪林弹雨里
either the shelling gets us...

249
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,950
就是被伊斯兰国弄死
or ISIL does.

250
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,730
这些情况你完全无动于衷吗
Does any of this phase you at all?

251
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,040
我们都快要全部死在这了
The fact that we're gonna die in here?

252
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,370
我们不会死的 我们都会出去的
We're not gonna die. We're still getting out.

253
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,840
所有人
All of us.

254
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,180
怎么走啊 走房顶吗
How's that? The roof?

255
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,350
-房顶走不了了  -就是要走房顶
- The roof ain't happening. - The roof is happening.

256
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,350
我们没时间再想一个逃脱计划出来了
We don't have time to come up with another escape plan.

257
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,620
所以你的确在紧张
So you are nervous.

258
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,390
棒极了 我就知道我要出事
Great, now I know I'm in deep crap.

259
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,830
我这么做就只是为了钱
I'm only doing this for the money.

260
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,900
不要觉得我们忽然就是朋友了
Don't think you and I are suddenly good.

261
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,370
你就把我送到酋长那就行
You just deliver me the sheik.

262
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,070
酋长们离这很远
The sheiks are well away from here.

263
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,770
在沙漠深处
High desert.

264
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,440
我也从来没听说过谁
And I've never heard of one

265
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,010
被叫做光之酋长的
being referred to as Sheik of Light.

266
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,610
意思就是 这也许是个暗语
Which means it's probably a code.

267
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,580
他了解你兄弟
She knows your brother.

268
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,910
这块胶带...
This tape--

269
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,850
是唯一不属于这张纸的部分
it's the only thing that doesn't belong.

270
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,520
你兄弟在和我们猜谜语啊
Your brother speaks in riddles,

271
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,490
是吧 这可能是布莱叶盲文
does he? ‭Maybe it's Braille

272
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,660
或者 摩斯电码
or, Morse.

273
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,030
或者就是数字
Or just numbers.

274
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,670
我觉得是个电话号
I think it's a phone number.

275
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
语音信箱

280
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,100
感谢你花时间见我们
Thanks for taking the time to see us.

281
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,900
大家都去哪了
Where is everybody?

282
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,100
他们都提前逃跑了
They are fleeing ahead of the advance.

283
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,810
我们也在试着找总监
We have been trying to reach him.

284
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,810
我们只知道他去郊区了
All we know is that he went to the suburbs

285
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,880
要找他女儿
to try to find his daughter.

286
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,180
你有她地址吗
Do you have an address for her?

287
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,650
我们打电话给她  但是没人接
We tried calling her, but no answer.

288
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,780
这是地址
Address is here.

289
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,150
你不会是想要找到他吧
You are not going to try to find him, are you?

290
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,560
那就祝愿真主保佑你们吧
God be with you, then.

291
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,200
地址给你们圈出来了
Circled the address.

292
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,430
你们好运吧
Good luck.

293
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,070
你和我们一起去
You're coming with us.

294
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,700
你要是觉得我会去郊区的话
If you think I'm going into the suburbs,

295
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,970
那你一定是疯了
you're crazy.

296
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,500
郊区怎么了
What's wrong with the suburbs?

297
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,940
郊区就在那边
The suburbs are out there.

298
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,640
战争前线
The front line of the war.

299
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,810
很高兴认识你 本杰明
Nice knowing you, Benjamin.

300
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,150
我希望下次
I hope next time

301
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,650
是在好一些的境况下见到你
it's under better circumstances.

302
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,380
-钱拿来  -你得把我们送过检查关口
- Pay up. - You have to get us past the checkpoint.

303
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,390
我们两个美国人 没你去不了
Two Americans-- we'll never make it without you.

304
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,720
我不想死
I am not getting myself killed.

305
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,920
给钱
Pay up.

306
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,620
送我们去见酋长
Deliver the sheik.

307
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,590
然后就给你钱
Then you get your money.

308
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,300
上车
Get in.

309
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,520
喂
Yes?

310
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,590
你应该看看你的邮箱 萨拉
You should check your e-mail, Sara.

311
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,400
这是什么啊
What am I looking at?

312
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,430
是一个猎人四年前拍下的镜头
Footage captured by a hunter four years ago.

313
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,900
那些挂在树上的运动传感器里有一个
One of those motion sensor devices you hang on trees,

314
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,940
间间断断地拍摄猎物的照片
takes intermittent photos of prey.

315
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,310
那个猎人有天早上看到了这些照片
Hunter comes out one morning, finds these images.

316
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,620
这个就是我跟你说过的那个杀人事件
This is the killing I was telling you about.

317
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,430
受害者是哈兰·盖恩斯 中情局的副主任
The victim's Harlan Gaines, Deputy Chief of the CIA.

318
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,130
而杀手是
And the killer...

319
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,530
你看得到
well, you can see,

320
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,500
也就是我们叫做迈克尔·斯科菲尔德的人
it's who we call Michael Scofield,

321
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,020
或者说 坎尼尔·奥提斯 或者...
or Kaniel Outis, or...

322
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,670
这和他们对林肯设的局完全吻合
This is exactly what they did to Lincoln.

323
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,870
但是第二天就有血证了
And then there's the blood evidence the next day.

324
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,310
坎尼尔或是迈克尔或是管他谁飞去了也门
Kaniel or Michael or whatever gets on a flight to Yemen.

325
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,510
我们差点就在他落地的时候抓到他了
We almost nail him when he lands.

326
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,710
他逃跑了
He gets away.

327
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,210
但他的行李还在
His luggage doesn't

328
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,610
行李中的衣服满是盖恩斯的血
and Gaines' blood is all over the clothes inside.

329
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,380
这是无可辩驳的证据
The evidence is overwhelming.

330
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,220
不管你叫他什么
Whatever name you want to call him,

331
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,960
迈克尔都是杀人犯 萨拉
Michael's a murderer, Sara.

332
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,580
你还好吗
Are you all right?

333
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,260
你好吗
You all right?

334
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,020
这副老身板吗
Oh, this old thing?

335
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,060
我挺好的
Yeah, I'm doing fine.

336
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,240
怎么了
What's going on?

337
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,100
我需要你的建议
I need your advice.

338
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,740
也许你不是很想
It's probably something you're not gonna

339
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
和我谈这个
want to talk about.

340
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,750
我现在真的很需要你的清晰思路
I could really use your clarity right now.

341
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,040
是有关迈克尔的
It's about Michael.

342
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,540
还是很想知道他是怎么塞进去的
Still want to know how he got that in here.

343
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,660
脱光了和狱警拥抱
Hugging naked with the guards.

344
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,980
只有那样 对吗
Got to be, right?

345
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,620
什么情况
What the hell is that?

346
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,320
"我们是冠军"
"We are the Champions."

347
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,300
像现在这样被困在尿壶里 还会去看皇后乐队的演出吗
You get stuck in a Porta-Potty like this, you go Queen?

348
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,710
我是说
I mean, where are the girls

349
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,500
难道不是应该看小黄片吗 对吧
riding the washing machines, right?

350
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,280
再看我的屏幕 它就会刺进你的眼球里
Look at my screen again, this goes in your eye.

351
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,180
你知道的 这世界从不缺惊艳
You know, the world never ceases to amaze.

352
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,700
当你被困在一个中东的监狱里时
You get stuck in a Middle Eastern prison,

353
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,740
最大的混蛋却是个韩国人
the biggest S.O.B. Is a Korean.

354
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,260
他戒断症发作了
He's in withdrawal.

355
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,720
你知道吗 他是这个世界上
You know, he's the biggest collector

356
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,600
皇后乐队用品的最大收藏家
of Queen paraphernalia in the world.

357
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,160
据说他在首尔的房子是佛瑞迪·莫库瑞的圣祠[皇后乐队主唱]
They say his house in Seoul is a shrine to Freddy Mercury.

358
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,650
但他怎么会在这里
And he got in here how?

359
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,160
身份盗窃
Identity theft.

360
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,100
显然他过去就坐在他的沙发上
Apparently he used to sit on his couch,

361
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,740
黑掉世界各地的高净值账户
hack high net worth accounts all over the world.

362
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,520
把钱变成了一堆收集品 悍马 直升机
Turned it into a collection of Hummers, helicopters

363
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,620
当然还有佛瑞迪·莫库瑞的骨灰
and, apparently, Freddy Mercury's ashes.

364
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,320
等等 你是说尸体焚化后的骨灰吗
Wait, you mean like his burnt-up body?

365
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,330
故事的内容是佛瑞迪被火化了 但是他的骨灰失踪了
The story is Freddy's cremated, but his ashes go missing.

366
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,640
至今没人知道他的骨灰在哪
To this day no one knows where they are.

367
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,940
贾曾经跟我承认过 在他人生巅峰时 他买下了骨灰
Ja admitted to me once when he was high he bought them.

368
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,340
两百万美元
Two million bucks.

369
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,810
他在起居室里摆放了皇后乐队主唱的骨灰
He's got Queen's lead singer in his family room.

370
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,680
你到底是怎么知道这些的
How exactly do you know all this?

371
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,760
我问的他
I asked him.

372
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,020
他戒断症没有发作时 还是个不错的人
He's a real mensch when he's not in withdrawal.

373
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,860
我完全不知道你和他说过话
I didn't know you talked to him.

374
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,600
真厉害
Amazing.

375
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,560
就像我刚以为自己了解你的计划 但其实并没有
Just when I think I know your game, I don't.

376
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,380
你知道我的计划 维普
You know my game, Whip.

377
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,760
看 就像这样 "维普"
See, right there, "Whip."

378
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,380
我甚至不知道你为什么这么叫我
I don't even know why you call me that.

379
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,040
因为你是我的右手
Because you're my whip hand.

380
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,790
我最后的王牌
My ace in the hole.

381
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,560
嗯 当然 好吧
Yeah, sure, okay.

382
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,980
你看 在博弈论中 事物都具有两面性
See, in game theory, it serves you to be two-faced.

383
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,660
成为每个人的朋友 直到你不再是他们的朋友
Be everyone's friend till the moment you're not.

384
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,510
当他们不喜欢你时 你让他们非常喜欢你
You make them love you so much that when they're up against it,

385
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,560
他们的忠诚就会使他们做出
their loyalty will make them act

386
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,610
违背他们最佳利益的选择
against their own best interests.

387
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,560
这就是博弈论
That's game theory.

388
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,680
一个无情却又合理的赢法
A cold, rational focus on winning.

389
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,820
即使那会损害别人的利益
Even if it's at everyone else's expense.

390
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,300
我想要知道的是 他想得到什么
What I'm trying to understand is what he stands to gain.

391
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,280
抛下他的家庭 还有... 他的新身份
Leaving his family, and... and the new identity.

392
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,460
透过你告诉我的那些简短描述 他是与众不同的人
According to the little you've told me, he was different.

393
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,180
总是事先计划好 对吗
Always an agenda, right?

394
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,800
是的
Yeah.

395
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,080
我是说 他显然很爱你
I mean, he apparently loved you.

396
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,570
他当然爱你
Of course he loved you.

397
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,980
他怎么可能不爱你
How could he not?

398
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,780
但他同样也需要你为他打开
But he also wanted you to open that door

399
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,520
监狱里的那道门
in the prison for him.

400
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,980
我是说 真正的博弈论
I mean, true game theory,

401
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,940
每件事 每个人
everything, everyone

402
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,680
都具有偶然性
is a contingency.

403
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,180
你遇见一些人 你让他们走进了你的生活
You meet people, you bring them into your life

404
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,560
你让他们渗透你的生活 直到你需要
and you keep them percolating until the moment

405
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,520
利用这段关系来获得自己的利益
you need to manipulate the relationship to your advantage.

406
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,380
我不是在评价谁 你知道的 我不会那么做
I'm not judging, you know? That's not my thing.

407
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,170
-我知道  -你了解我 但是...
-I know. -You know me. But...

408
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,940
计划被计算的那么精准那么长远
schema as deep and as calculating as that can,

409
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,100
最终
in the end,

410
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,400
会将一个人变成疯子
spin a man off into madness.

411
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,950
他起初可能会想 为了更伟大的利益
He might initially think smaller evils are okay

412
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,860
一点小错无伤大雅
in the service of a greater good.

413
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,840
就像带着林肯越狱
Like breaking Lincoln out of prison.

414
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,320
但是正义与邪恶的博弈可能会变得混乱
But the dance of good and evil could become jumbled,

415
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,430
然后他自身的利益就会成为
and the manipulation itself becomes

416
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,880
最重要的事
the most important thing.

417
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,320
成为赢家
Becomes about winning

418
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,260
比到底该不该赢更重要了
rather than whether the game should be won at all.

419
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,480
我还没见过你像现在这样害怕过
I don't think I've seen you this scared before.

420
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,200
他们说 在斋月 作为宽恕的表现
They say, for Ramadan, as an act of forgiveness,

421
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,950
他们会释放
they're going to release

422
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,920
那边隔离区的所有囚犯
all prisoners from solitary over there

423
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,160
放回到普通囚犯中
back into general population.

424
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,860
没有比这更糟的事了
Worst of the worst.

425
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,700
伊斯兰国的狂热信徒
ISIL fanatics.

426
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,320
阿布·拉马尔
Abu Ramal.

427
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,920
他们会杀了我 你知道的
They're going to kill me, you know.

428
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,480
政府判了我20年
Government gave me 20 years

429
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,240
就因为我是同性恋
for homosexuality.

430
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,500
但那里面的怪物
But the monsters in there,

431
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,540
拉马尔和他的手下
Ramal and his men,

432
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,300
他们不会让我活过20分钟
won't let me live 20 minutes.

433
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,640
请你告诉我
Please tell me

434
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,280
你依旧打算把我们从这里带出去
you still plan on getting us out of here.

435
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,780
你原本应该让监狱断电
You were responsible for killing the lights,

436
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,420
但是你的光之酋长刚好在错误的时间
and then your Sheik of Light went missing

437
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,570
失踪了
at exactly the wrong time.

438
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,720
我不知道他发生了什么
I don't know what happened to him.

439
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,620
也许我能找到别的方法
Maybe I can find another way.

440
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,000
你确实还能做一些事情
There is something you could do.

441
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,620
给我一片口香糖
Give me a piece of that gum.

442
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,820
一片口香糖能换我们离开监狱吗
Piece of gum is going to get us out of prison?

443
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,340
它会启动进程
It'll start the process.

444
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,660
有时候 朋友 我真的不知道应该相信什么
Sometimes, my friend, I can't tell which is bigger,

445
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,530
你的计划 还是你的谎言
your plans or your lies.

446
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,840
我觉得你在针对我 你叫我骗子
I take that personally, you calling me a liar.

447
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,100
然后我会让你知道 就像蝴蝶效应一样
And I'm gonna show you, just like the butterfly's wings,

448
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,020
这片口香糖会引发一系列的事情
this piece of gum is gonna start a sequence of events

449
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,160
然后在地球的另一端 圆满落幕
that will finish on the other side of the world.

450
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,040
电池 拜托
Battery, please.

451
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,120
监狱打火机
Prison lighter.

452
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,120
维普 我需要你的袜子
Whip, I need your socks.

453
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,760
西德 水壶
Sid, water can.

454
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,680
外面怎么样了
How we doing out there?

455
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,760
没被发现 快一点
We're all good. Quick though.

456
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,420
好了
Okay.

457
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,240
嘿
Hey.

458
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,540
你确定要这么做吗
You sure about this?

459
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,780
没时间了
There's no time left.

460
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,360
这城市快沦陷了
The city's about to collapse.

461
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,520
非常时期 非常手段
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

462
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,770
搞定
Got it.

463
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,140
快点 快点 快点
Come on, come on, come on.

464
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,380
快去 快去
Go, go, go.

465
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,360
警卫
Guards!

466
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,150
这里有人生病了
We got a sick one in here.

467
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,780
什么情况
What is this?

468
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,980
他烧得厉害 得去医务室
He's burning up, he needs the infirmary.

469
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,340
拜托了
Please.

470
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,280
就是这儿了
This is it.

471
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,700
政府管辖范围的边界
Limit of government control.

472
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,420
过了这儿就是伊斯兰国的领域了
Anything after this is ISIL territory.

473
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,440
停车
Stop.

474
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,840
我来跟他们说
Let me do the talking.

475
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,620
他说我们几个是西方人加一个女人
He's says us being Westerners, a woman...

476
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,830
多半有去无回
we go inside, we are not coming back.

477
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,880
他们不让我们进去
They're not letting us through.

478
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,680
告诉他 我用五百美元跟他打赌 我们会毫发无损地回来
Tell him I bet $500 bucks we'll make it back in one piece.

479
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,840
他没有五百块跟你赌
He doesn't have $500 to bet.

480
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,100
没关系
It doesn't matter.

481
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,720
如果我们回不来 他就把钱留下
We don't make it back, he keeps it.

482
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,420
他说我们在自寻死路
He says we have a death wish.

483
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,240
很好
Fine.

484
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,880
这座城市原来很漂亮 生机勃勃的
The city used to be beautiful, alive.

485
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,500
看看他们都把它糟蹋成什么样子了
Look what they've done to it.

486
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,580
他们把阿布·拉马尔画到墙上了
They're putting up portraits of Abu Ramal.

487
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,180
看来他被关在奥杰吉厄监狱之后
He's only gotten more powerful

488
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,760
变得更强大了
since he got locked up in Ogygia.

489
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,800
要是他出狱了 那就只有真主保佑了
God help us if he gets out.

490
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,280
伊斯兰国
ISIL.

491
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,740
我们得停车了 趴下
We're gonna get stopped. Get down.

492
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,260
马上
Down now.

493
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,220
藏好
Cover up.

494
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,380
不可思议
Can't believe this.

495
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,160
我认识他
I know him.

496
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,320
雷扎
Reza.

497
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,400
现在我叫阿布·埃米尔
It's Abu Amir now.

498
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,110
你来郊区这里做什么 希巴
What are you doing in the suburbs, Sheba?

499
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,800
走错了
Took a wrong turn.

500
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,090
你把你的头发包起来了
You got your hair covered up.

501
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,800
很好
That's good.

502
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,400
你终于找到你的真主了吗
Finally find God?

503
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,080
和你信仰的真主不一样
Not your God.

504
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,080
世上只有一个真主
There is only one God.

505
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,500
我们会拿下这座城市 你知道的
We're gonna take the city, you know.

506
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,040
如果你表现好...
You be nice...

507
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,820
或许我会让你做我的女人
maybe I'll make a good woman of you.

508
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,730
原谅你的不好
Forgive the devil in you.

509
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,460
不如我马上掉头
Why don't I just turn around now?

510
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,040
我们原谅彼此
We forgive each other.

511
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,560
原谅对方曾经出现在自己生命里
Forget each other ever existed.

512
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,320
美人没那么容易被遗忘
Beauty is not so easily forgotten.

513
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,010
罗密欧
Lover boy

514
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,420
我们得走了
We have to go.

515
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,500
政府军到阿克萨公园了
Government's moving in at Aksa Park.

516
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,490
放她走
Cut her loose.

517
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,980
滚出我们的地盘
Get the hell off our territory.

518
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,970
他们走了
They are gone.

519
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,880
我们得抓紧
We have to hurry.

520
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,560
幸好他刚刚没当场杀了我
We're lucky he didn't kill me right then.

521
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,680
为什么
Why?

522
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,020
或许以后再告诉你吧
Maybe I'll tell you one day.

523
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,660
他们在摧毁我们的城市
They're destroying our city.

524
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,320
你伊斯兰国的朋友在摧毁我们的城市
Your ISIL friends are destroying our city.

525
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,480
而你却来这里
And you come in here

526
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,240
希望我们帮你
wanting help.

527
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,780
只要给我拿点药什么的
Just give me a little something.

528
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,130
这里有医生吗 我要烧成灰了
Is there a doctor here? I'm burning up.

529
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,170
你贩卖枪支的时候
You should have thought about that

530
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,040
你刺杀无辜人民的时候
when you supplied guns to them,

531
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,680
你就应该想到这一点
assassinated good men.

532
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,950
那些指控子虚乌有
Those charges were misunderstanding

533
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,870
坎尼尔·奥提斯说他是冤枉的
Kaniel Outis says it was misunderstanding

534
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,484
那你一到这个监狱就想越狱
Was it also misunderstanding when you

535
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,640
也是被冤枉的吗
tried to escape the moment you got into this prison?

536
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:06,640
一个清白的人不用逃跑 他会请律师
An honest man doesn't try to escape. He asks for a lawyer.

537
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,550
但你...你进来的第一个星期就想越狱
But you... you tried to escape the very first week.

538
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,060
要是我做主的话 恐怕我会让你在这里孤独终老
I doubt that you would be in solitary forever if it was up to me.

539
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,120
地址在街区尽头
The address at the end of the block.

540
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,840
叛军...
Rebels...

541
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,310
就在房子前面
right in front of the house.

542
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,120
去你妈的
Son of a bitch.

543
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,650
这个国家哪件事顺利过
Anything easy in this country?

544
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,020
问题在于酋长在里面吗
The question is: is the sheik even inside?

545
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,560
只有一个办法才能知道了
Only one way to find out.

546
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,090
如果他们发现我们在这里
They find us up here,

547
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,090
我们无从解释
there's no explaining ourselves.

548
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,560
必死无疑
We're all dead.

549
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,820
安静
Quiet.

550
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,690
你们...你们不是伊斯兰国的
You... You are not ISIL?

551
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,230
不是 不过 你是默罕默德·阿尔·突尼斯 对吗
No. But you're Mohammad El-Tunis, I take it?

552
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,280
我们从市中心的 来带你离开
We are from the city center. We are here to get you out.

553
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,560
不带上我女儿我是不会走的
Not without my daughter.

554
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,700
可以 她在哪里
We can bring her. Where is she?

555
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,640
-她在那里  -哪里
- She's out there. - Where?

556
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,580
在街对面校舍的地下室里
In the basement of the schoolyard, across the street.

557
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,240
被伊斯兰国的人关起来了
Pinned since ISIL arrived.

558
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,160
我来这带她走
I came to get her out.

559
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,780
结果我也被关起来了
And I got pinned, too.

560
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,620
不是我乌鸦嘴 林肯 不过我觉得
I hate to say it, Linc, but I think we might've

561
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,000
我们可能也被关在这里了
just got pinned as well.

562
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,650
你还好吗
You okay?

563
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,390
你那样子就好像你可以用一点锋利工具
You look like you could use a few sharp edges

564
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,020
保护自己一样
knocked off your world.

565
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,540
你自己看起来也一副怂样啊
You don't look so good yourself.

566
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,060
你想从也门搞到什么药物
Say what you want about Yemen,

567
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,510
他们对药物一点也不小气
they're not shy about prescriptions.

568
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,700
这可是好东西 含吗啡的药片
It's the good stuff. Morphine derivative.

569
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,810
我要用你的手机 还要一张信用卡
I need access to your cell phone and a credit card number.

570
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,860
做什么
Why?

571
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,900
点份披萨
I want to order a pizza.

572
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,160
有扇后门
There's a back door,

573
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,240
通往校舍 快走
toward the schoolhouse. Come on.

574
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,400
来不及了
Too late.

575
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,000
上房顶
Go to the rooftops.

576
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,140
他们都在车那边
They're all over the Rover.

577
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,060
-我们过不去的  -我可以把那辆小货车开来
- We'll never get to it. - ‭I can get in that pickup,

578
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,780
再顺便给他们弄点麻烦
make a ruckus on my way out.

579
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,240
幸运地话 他们都会来追我
Any luck, they'll be all over me.

580
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,080
那你们就有机会跑到车那里了
Then you got a clean shot to the Rover.

581
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,840
快走 走
Go. Go!

582
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,840
我不走
I'm not leaving

583
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,900
不能抛下我女儿啊
without my daughter.

584
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,580
你不明白伊斯兰国的人为了调教她们
You don't know what ISIL will do to her

585
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,100
会做出什么事来
for educating those girls.

586
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,940
我会把她带出来的 我向你保证
I'll get her out, I promise.

587
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,860
-走啊  -好 好
-Go! -Okay! Okay.

588
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,340
你爸爸让我来接你走
Your father sent me. I'm getting you out of here.

589
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,660
快点 快走
Come on! Come on!

590
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,200
趴下 别动
Get down! Stay down!

591
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,880
他必须要逃出来
He's got to make it.

592
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,460
你知道你必须要逃出来 加油
You know you got to make it. Come on.

593
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,440
他在那 在那呢
There he is! There he is!

594
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,860
欧耶 宝贝
Yeah, baby!

595
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,660
不 不 坏事了
Oh, no. This isn't good.

596
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,280
坏大事了
This isn't good.

597
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,480
这是政府的检查点
This government checkpoint.

598
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,660
他们会误认为我们是自杀式炸弹 我们必须要停车
They'll think we're suicide bombers. We have to stop.

599
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,590
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

600
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,260
别开枪
Don't shoot at us!

601
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,320
别开枪 别开枪
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

602
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,100
趴下
Stay down!

603
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,440
我也高兴
I'm so happy, too.

604
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,120
对不起...
Forgive me, uh...

605
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,640
她们的父母都被杀了
Their parents have been killed.

606
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,780
我还没找到帮助她们的法子
I'm trying to figure out how I can help them.

607
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,420
她们可以暂时待在这里
They can stay here for now.

608
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,240
只要你告诉我 你跟奥杰吉厄监狱里哪个人有联系
As long as you tell me who you know in Ogygia,

609
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,140
还有他们为什么这么需要你
and why they want you so bad.

610
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,300
我有...
I'm a man with, uh...

611
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,560
几个麻烦孩子
troublesome children.

612
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,180
他们都很出色
They're beautiful.

613
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,850
只是对于这个国家可能思想太超前了
But perhaps too modern for this country.

614
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,320
我女儿想要教育女孩子
My daughter tries to educate girls.

615
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,100
我的儿子
And my son,

616
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,240
他爱上了另一个男人
he falls in love with another man.

617
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,280
被判了20年监禁在奥杰吉厄监狱
They gave him 20 years in Ogygia Prison.

618
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,420
我几周前去探视他
I went to visit him a few weeks ago.

619
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,120
他说 也许有办法逃出去
He said, maybe there is a way out.

620
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,380
而且我能帮上忙
A way I could help.

621
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,900
要是眼睁睁看着家人死
A man is not a man

622
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,040
那我还是什么男人
if he would let his family die.

623
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,760
你同意帮他
You agreed to help him.

624
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,040
怎么帮
How?

625
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,740
他说如果我能让监狱断电
He said if I could arrange a blackout,

626
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,920
他...他认识一个能帮他逃出去的人
he... he knew someone who could get him out.

627
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,060
美国人吗
An American?

628
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,580
我也不知道
I don't know.

629
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
我...我一周前就应该做的
I... I was supposed to do this a week ago,

630
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,540
但我女儿出了事
but then this happened with my daughter.

631
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,120
谢天谢地你找到了我们
Thank God you found us.

632
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,960
现在还有时间
There's still time to do it.

633
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,700
他们还在牢里等着你呢
They're waiting for you in there.

634
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,180
那我现在就得去
Then I have to go now.

635
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,900
他说我得在停电前
He said I was to give a signal

636
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,340
24小时给他们发信号
exactly 24 hours before the blackout.

637
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,300
让电流波动两次
I will pulse the power grid twice.

638
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,080
这城市可能撑不了24小时了
This city may not have 24 hours in it.

639
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,680
大伙 再见
Bye, guys.

640
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,260
再见
Bye.

641
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,900
都知道我看人眼光不好
God knows I'm no perfect judge of character,

642
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,580
但是 迈克尔
but Michael?

643
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,040
要是他们说的有一点是真的...
If any of what they're saying is true...

644
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,780
你还要再去了解 萨拉
So there's more to find out, Sara.

645
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,520
重要的是 你会挺过来的
I mean, the important thing is that you are gonna survive this,

646
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,900
不管真相怎么样
however it turns out.

647
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,200
我们会在这儿支持你的 好吗
And we're here for you. Okay?

648
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,780
-咱们走  -谢谢你

00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:18,840

651
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,960
你好 我能进去把迈克带走吗

所有的孩子都已经走了
All the kids have been released.

653
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,720
你没接到他吗
You don't have him?

654
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,540
迈克

655
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,600

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,920

661
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,640

你干什么呢 吓死我了
What are you doing? You scared me.

663
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,260
我在找那个男人去哪儿了

664

给我这个的人
The man that gave me this.

666

迈克尔
Michael.

669
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,100
你到底卷进了什么事
What are you into?

670
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,120
伊斯兰国每小时都在逼近
ISIL is getting closer by the hour.

671
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,500
那群造反的人也知道了
And the rebels in here know it.

672
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,380
等他们掌控了城市 会杀了我们所有人
When they take over, they'll kill all of us.

673
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:33,160
不忠的人 有罪的人 还有外国人
Infidels, the sinners, the foreigners.

674
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,200
老天爷
Praise Allah.

675
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,960
有人找到我爸了
Someone found my father.

676
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,960
那逃跑计划可以开始了
Means the escape is on.

677
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,700
现在开始24小时倒计时
24 hours from now.

678
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,740
估计来不及了
But this may be too late.

679
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,840
斋月开始了
Ramadan has begun.

680
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,260
狱警开始放囚犯了
The guards are releasing the prisoners.

681
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,240
阿布·拉马尔 还有他手下
